<p>After drifting off to sleep, I wake up a couple hours later and the rain has stopped and I can see some clear sky.  OK, this seems like the same pattern as the two previous nights - evening thunderstorm and then it clears at night.  If I can get up and hang some of my wet clothes out to dry, maybe they'll catch some morning sun and things will get a bit drier before I start hiking in the morning.  So, I put up the clothesline on some neighboring trees and hang up everything that's wet or partially wet.  I have my rain jacket on the line, my two shirts and all three pairs of hiking socks.  I crawl back into bed and go back to sleep.</p>

<p>Sometime later in the night, it starts raining again.  At first, it's a light rain, then a heavy rain, then huge bolts of lightning and thunder.  Now, it's pouring.  Oh great, just about every shred of clothing I have is sitting out there on a clothesline in the rain.  For some items, it's no big deal as they were soaked anyway, but I hung up lots of things that were just damp and now they're all soaked.  Well nothing more I can do now as they're already wet - might as well just leave them there and get some more sleep.</p>

<p>I don't know it at the time, but I find out later that one of those lightning strikes this evening started a forest fire near Mammoth Pool Reservoir and Huntington Lake (10-15 miles away) which ends up burning more than 20,000 acres over the next couple weeks and putting some serious forest fire smoke onto much of the northern part of the JMT.  The smoke seems to generally drift northeast and I'm headed south so I never even know about it until I get back.</p>

<p>But, remember how my permit was actually supposed to be for a July 19th start and somehow an administrative goof issued one for July 13th.  If we had started on July 19th, we would have been right in the middle of the worst part of the forest fire smoke.  The JMT itself wasn't threatened by the fire, but many on the trail were affected by the smoke in the days behind us on the trail.  I read accounts by people who had to quit the JMT before finishing and many said that the smoke they had to deal with was one of the contributing factors.</p>

<p>I wake up early the next morning (~5am) and it is still raining.  I can see that a little rain got onto my groundcloth and the foot of my sleeping bag is a bit damp, but all-in-all my shelter is fine.  But, I'm thinking about the fact that it's still raining and I have almost no items of clothing that are dry.  My boots are soaked and I have no dry socks.  My rain jacket is completely soaked through and wet on inside and out.  I'm thinking that I probably have to stay here in the tent until it stops raining and if it just keeps raining all day, I probably have to stay here all day and then I'll be behind schedule by a day and I'll have to hike 4-5 miles back to MTR to pick up another day's worth of food from the hiker bins so I don't run out at the end of my trip.  Man, what a mess that would be.  All this runs through my head numerous times as I'm laying there in the early morning pondering the details of the situation.</p>

<p>Curiously, by all rights I should have been questioning what in the heck I was doing attempting this part of the hike solo in such crummy weather, but honestly that never crossed my mind.  I was completely absorbed by the challenges and decisions I was facing that I didn't really sit back and think about whether I should pack it in and go try to find Pete and join them on the way home.  Instead, what I'm thinking about is that if I can get over Muir Pass sometime tomorrow morning, then I can probably make the rest of the JMT by myself.  If this climb up to Muir Pass with my heavy pack is too much for me or takes too long, then I'll probably have to turn around, go back down the MTR and find my way home.  OK, so whenever the weather breaks, that's what I need to focus on.  Get over Muir Pass tomorrow morning some time.  To do that, I need to make really good progress on the climb up towards Muir Pass with my heavy pack.  If I can get over the pass tomorrow, then I can probably do the rest of the JMT.  If not, then I'll have to re-evaluate.  This is a pretty big test.</p>

<p>Sometime around 6am, it finally stops raining, but I've been awake since much earlier waiting for it to stop.  I slipped on my jacket (still dry) and my sandals and wandered over to the laundry line.  OK, I guess all my clothes have just gotten a night of fresh water rinse.  I wring out as much water as I can from all the clothes and start thinking about what I should wear for hiking.  All my underwear, shorts and shirts are wet, but I think that maybe if I wring them out super well, they'll dry while I wear them.  I'm just going to have to put on wet socks.  With three pairs of socks, I made a significant mistake and I should have made 100% sure that at least one pair of socks was dry.  I have a dry bag for clothes so I could have assured that some socks stayed dry, but I didn't.  That's a lesson learned.  In the Maslow's hierarchy of sock importance, dry comes before clean so you'd rather have the socks be dry and dirty than clean and wet.  Yes, this stuff actually runs through your mind in situations like this.  But, this time, all I have is wet and rinsed with fresh water - there are no dry socks.  I briefly think about building a fire and trying to dry things out over the fire, but when I look around everything is completely soaked.  It would be quite a job to get a fire started and I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to have a fire here (as it turns out fires were not allowed).  Never mind, lets just dry the day's clothes while wearing them and hope I can manage with wet socks for a day.</p>

    <figcaption>
        Here&#39;s the little piece of semi-sloping land I found in the middle of the rain storm to pitch my tent the night before
    </figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I cook myself breakfast and enjoy having something hot and then it's time to start packing up.  Unfortunately for me, the sequence of loading my pack is that the sleeping bag and tent must go into the bottom compartment first, then the bear container goes into the top compartment sitting on top of the previous two items.  It's no big deal to pack up the sleeping bag first, but when there's not a dry square inch anywhere to set things on, it's not easy to pack up the tent and find a place to stage everything else that was in the tent.  Plus, it's no fun to pack up a wet, muddy tent while still trying to keep the upper surface of the ground cloth from getting any wetter or muddier than it already is.  In general, everything is a mess.</p>

<p>While much of the JMT is on granite or granite sand and doesn't really make mud, that's not the case here.  There's mud everywhere.  I stack up some rocks to make a place to set things I'm taking out of the tent and I finally manage to get the soaking wet tent packed up and into the pack.  I can then load the bear container and start putting everything else into the pack around the bear container.  This whole process is just slow.  At least I get everything except for the wet clothes into the pack.  OK, now it's time to put on the wet clothes.  On goes the wet underwear (ohhh that feels chilly).  On goes the wet shirt (woahhh that's really cold).  On goes the wet socks and I stuff my feet into the wet boots.  I grab a pair of socks for tomorrow and hang them on the outside of the pack (hoping they will dry during the day).  At last I'm packed up and I start hiking at about 9am.  The pack feels heavier than I was expecting, but that's probably because so many things are wet.  As I start hiking and making my own heat, the wet clothes don't feel so bad.  I'm probably saved because it isn't very cold or windy.  Within an hour the clothes I'm wearing feel mostly dry except for my socks.</p>

<p>Hiking with wet socks, my fear is that I'll get some serious blisters and it will be hard to treat/protect the feet if the socks stay wet.  I'm really, really, really hoping it doesn't rain more today even though the sky looks pretty threatening.  I've got a pair of socks hanging on my pack (trying to dry them out) for tomorrow.  If it starts to rain at all, I've got to stop and put those in the dry bag at the first rain drop because the last thing I want is for those socks to get even wetter (like they did the night before).  Ok, firmly in the priority for each day is to assure myself of dry socks for the next day.  Clean AND dry would be even better, but if you can only have one, make sure you at least have dry.
The trail is ascending along the San Joaquin River, but not very steeply.  Then, I get to a bridge across the river at Franklin Meadow and here's where the San Joaquin River and Evolution Creek split and I'm going to follow Evolution Creek up into Evolution Valley.  There are lots of wet looking people on the trail this morning, including a group of Boy Scouts.   Apparently, Evolution Valley is a popular backpacking destination and folks can come in from the west through MTR or in from the east down Piute Canyon/Creek.</p>

<p>After crossing the river on the bridge, the trail splits in a couple directions and one branch makes a 180 degree turn which confuses me.  After confirming directions on the map, the trail hits some really steep sections.  It switches back and forth over huge boulders and steps carved in the granite.  The full weight of my pack hits me like a ton of bricks.  I was fine on the gentle trail I had earlier in the morning, but holy cow, this is hard.  It's steep, there are giant steps to get up these boulders, my pack is heavy and even though I've been at this altitude over the previous week (I'm only at 8500') and I've trained with this much weight in the pack, I haven't done both before and haven't done it on this steep and rocky trail.</p>

<p>I'm experimenting with how best to handle the heavier pack.  Do I crank up the waist belt and take more weight on the hips or do I carry more weight on my shoulders.  I try taking more on my hips and I find that the adjustments that I have to make to get most of the weight on my hips cause my butt (glutes actually) to really burn when going uphill.  If I loosen up the hip belt some and take more weight on my shoulders, I don't get the big glute burn.  I'm missing the logic of this because the glutes have the same amount of work to do wither way, but maybe the tight hip belt is interfering with something.  Anyway, for now, my glutes need a break so I take more weight on my shoulders.  This is probably evidence that my pack isn't a perfect fit, but there's not much I can about it now.  The challenge will be whether my core can handle the extra shoulder load by the end of a long day.  I definitely was feeling core issues at the end of the day in the first half of the trip.</p>

<p>I take a break to do some maintenance on my feet and get a snack to eat and then start going again.  OK, slow the pace down.  Try to find a pace where you aren't out of breath.  Finally I get up the first steep section.  This section has been hard for everyone as many others have been stopped along the trail catching their breath.  After the steepest parts, the trail reconnects with Evolution Creek and it's really roaring today.  It must have rained a lot last night and perhaps even more at the higher elevations.</p>

<p>One more big steep section and then I can see I'm coming into Evolution Valley.  The trail will continue to climb, but at least it won't be as steep for awhile.  Not long into Evolution Valley, the trail wants to cross the now swollen Evolution Creek.  For the first time the entire trip, there's no way to get across the creek with dry feet.  The usual line of boulders that you can step across is hopelessly covered by the swollen river water.  There's a sign that you can cross either here or much further up on Evolution Creek.  I figure that rather than take my boots off and cross here, I may as well try further up the creek which, according to the sign, should be an easier crossing.  So now, I'm on the opposite side of the creek from the main trail and the trail on this side is pretty spotty.  I lose it several times, but then find it again and eventually I get up to the alternate crossing. As it turns out, this one doesn't help much.  It's a wet crossing too - the water isn't quite as swift, but no way to get across dry.</p>

<p>So, I take my boots and socks off and put my sandals on and wade across.  I hike in my sandals for a little while until I finally find a dry place I can sit down and put my boots back on.  Coincidentally, I also need to do some foot maintenance (really trying to avoid blisters with the wet socks).  I get my feet dry and cover them in baby powder (one of my magic ingredients for maintaining my feet) to help keep them dry and help keep the slippage between sock and skin rather than between layers of skin and then put my socks back on.  Low and behold, my socks are starting to dry.  My boots are still soaked and it probably doesn't help that the ground and grass is so wet everywhere too, but my socks are way drier than they were this morning.  My feet are doing OK.  I'm worried about my usual little toe hot spot and about some soreness on my heels which isn't a blister yet, but is getting sore.  I bandage those up and cover them in baby powder too and then it's off again.</p>

<p>Evolution Valley is a long valley dotted with meadows.  It starts with Evolution Meadow, then McClure Meadow (where there's a ranger station) and then Colby Meadow.  With all these meadows you would think it was fairly flat, but it still climbs almost 1000' from one end to the next.  The trail mostly doesn't touch the river and, while you can usually see the river, I end up getting water from the abundance of tributaries flowing into Evolution Creek.  The tributaries are all swollen from the night's rain and, in fact, a few of them are challenging to get across without getting wet.  Around the ranger station, I run into Diane, a solo hiker that I've seen on several previous days.  She's taking a midday break to see if she can dry out some of the things that she packed up wet this morning even though the sun isn't really out.  She was camped at Piute Creek last night with a father/son pair that she's been regularly camping with.  She apparently passed me this morning while I was in camp because she got a really early start this morning, leaving while it was still raining.</p>

<p>I catch up to a different father/son pair and hike with them for awhile.  They just got on the JMT and are doing a big loop.  They came over Piute Pass from North Lake, came down Piute Canyon and picked up the JMT where it intersects Piute Creek.  They're headed over Muir Pass, down to LeConte Canyon and then out to the east through Dusy Basin and over Bishop Pass to South Lake.  They haven't yet figured out how they're closing the loop from South Lake back to North Lake, maybe hitch hiking, maybe dropping their packs and walking back and then come pick up their packs.  Anyway, it's a 6 day loop.</p>

<p>It's interesting to note that while I'm out on the trail, I talk to almost everyone I see.  The usual introductory questions are "Where are you headed tonight?" and "Are you doing the whole JMT?" and then the conversation goes from there.  While I wouldn't normally be this outgoing with strangers, the somewhat instant camaraderie of the trail makes it easy and it probably helps that I'm alone so I'm happy to find someone to chat with for a little while.  It also tends to make the miles go quicker when you have someone to chat with.  Eventually the father/son stops for a food/water break and I charge on.    This section of the JMT seems to have a mix of through hikers and section hikers like the father/son I was just talking to so there's much more of a variety of answers to the question about where everyone is headed today.  The most common answer is Evolution Lake.  It's at 10,852' and maybe about 5-6 miles from Muir Pass.  I'd like to get to Sapphire Lake which is a bit higher and a couple miles closer to the pass.</p>

<p>At the end of Evolution Valley, there's a group of tributary creeks flowing in and the trail crisscrosses through them.  I start following what looks like the way to go and then I end up at a dead-end up against a rock wall.  Hmmm, where did the trail go?  I think what's going on is that the tributaries have way more water than normal and the normal visual clues that would tell you which way to go are under water.  I backtrack some and try a couple different directions.  It's a double challenge because I don't know where the trail is trying to get to or how to get across these tributaries while staying dry.  Eventually, I spy the trail on the other side of a couple of the tributaries.  At least now I know where I'm trying to get to now and just have to find a way across.  My socks have mostly dried so I'd really, really like to keep it that way.  It's an interesting game at this point.  You can't really see the whole way across so you start with what looks like a good place to cross the first part, you take that and then you see what your options are once you get there.  If you find no good options, you backtrack and then try something else.  After several tries, I finally find a way across and manage no more than few splashes on my boots.</p>

<p>Now the trail is leaving the river and heading seriously uphill on a series of switchbacks as I climb up 800' to Evolution Lake.   This section is as steep as the big set of switchbacks before Evolution Valley and the going is slow.  It's now mid-afternoon and I'm not quite as fresh as I was this morning.  After 20 minutes or so of climbing, I decide it's time for a break and I eat some food and drink a bunch.</p>

<p>One little treat I put in all my resupply buckets was a package of Starburst.  I had been eating a few earlier in the day, but I rediscover them so as I start hiking again, I'm sucking on a Starburst.  When hiking with our kids when they were little, we used to always bring some Starburst for the end of a long day (for them) because it would keep them busy and help them to enjoy the last part of the hike.  These magic little treats are doing the same thing for me.  Not only do they taste incredibly sweet, but they seem to boost your spirits a bit too and they provide a nice distraction from the rigors of the climb.  As we're going up the switchbacks, I start to get up higher above Evolution Meadow.  While I've been in the forest pretty much all day, now I can see the mountains back where I came from and some of the peaks up in front.  These are some impressive peaks around here.  A big knob of a peak stands out just across the creek (it's called The Hermit and is 12,328').  Mt Mendel and Mt Darwin loom ahead at 13,170 and 13,831.  The steepest part of the switchbacks seems behind me now, but it's still seriously uphill and I'm trying to figure out where Evolution Lake will be.  This is a game I've played seemingly a hundred times before.  You're climbing up to a glacial lake and trying to figure out where it is, but you can't actually see the lake until you climb up over the moraine, but you aren't sure where the moraine is until you can actually see the lake.  So, you never really know whether the next big rise is the moraine or whether it's around several more bends and several more rises.  The maps we're carrying are accurate, but a big enough scale that's it's tough to discern that level of detail.  The creek crossings and big turns in the trail are the easiest indicators, but often I can't really figure out whether I'm just about to the lake or have another mile to go. I imagine that's why the most common distance measure when hiking like this is "a mile, mile and a half".  It always seems like that's how far you have to go when you can't see your destination, even if it's actually only a couple hundred yards.</p>

<p>I come up over a moraine and there is indeed a lake, but it's a little tiny lake, not Evolution Lake.  OK, I can see where I am on the map - now it's not far.  I'm following the water running out of Evolution Lake and there are a few more little lakes and then finally I come over a rise and I can see Evolution Lake.  This feels like a significant milestone.  I'm going to be successful today and make it far enough to get over Muir Pass the next morning!  In addition, it's only about 3pm so I made good time today.  Evolution Lake is more than a mile long so I start the long journey around the north edge.  There are people resting along the trail at Evolution Lake, but I don't see anyone camped here.  My plan is go past Evolution Lake and up to Sapphire Lake which is the last legal camping spot before Muir Pass.</p>

<p>The trail diverts around a little hill and loses sight of Evolution Lake and then when it comes out again, I'm at Sapphire Lake!  Wow, this is great.  I'm here at my destination early.  I scout a bit for a place to camp.  There are no significant trees so it's going to be camping in the open.  I find a spot that will do, drop my pack there and then bound up the lake further to see if there are better spots.  I'm excited to be at camp so early.  The other spots up the lake further don't look any better so I hastily put up my laundry line between two scrubby, struggling pine trees that are only 5 feet high or so and I start hanging out my wet clothes.  The big advantage of getting to camp early is that you can wash and dry things.  I'm thinking how nice it would be to go for a swim in the lake and get clean.  I don't really need to wash anything today, but I really need to dry some things.  The sun makes occasional appearances, but even without it, I think things will slowly dry.  I lay down on a flat spot of dirt and just rest.  As part of the usual routine, I plan to send my position to Steph on the sat phone.  I go through the steps of acquiring my GPS position and I decide I'll check it out on the map to see exactly where it says I am.  Hmmm, that's odd, this position says I'm just at the upper part of Evolution Lake, not at Sapphire Lake.  OK, lets get a new GPS position and look at it again.  Same thing.  OK, get out the compass and see if you can take a heading on some of the major peaks.  That turns out not to be quite so easy because we're down in such a deep valley that it's hard to get a good enough view of the peaks to figure out which is which.  The peaks to the south are a little more spread out and I take a compass reading on what I think is The Hermit peak.  OK, sure enough I am indeed only at a different part of Evolution Lake.  That's odd.  I could have sworn I went past Evolution Lake up and over a new moraine and got to Sapphire Lake. Nope, I must have really just not been paying attention and the second part of Evolution Lake seemed like Sapphire Lake to me.</p>

<p>OK, take down all the laundry, pack everything up again and lets hike up to the actual Sapphire Lake!  Geez, that was embarrassing.  If I was just paying attention at all, that would have been avoided.  It's about 2 miles to get to Sapphire Lake (but not much uphill) so that takes about an hour.  Now, the weather is starting to cloud up on me and it looks like it could rain.  It isn't real obvious to me where the camping options are at Sapphire Lake.  There are two groups camped near the outlet (what you get to first) and I drop my pack near them just to look around and survey the options.  The trail starts climbing immediately and doesn't follow the lake and there are lots of rocks around the lake.  There don't look like a lot of options.  I chat with the other groups camped here and they say they'd be fine if I wanted to camp near them.  I find a relatively flat and somewhat sandy location and start putting up my tent.  We're definitely above the treeline here as there's nothing but decomposed granite, a few patches of vegetation and slabs of granite.  It's an easy place to set up the tent, but there's no place for a clothesline here.  As a substitute I lay things out on rocks hoping some warmth from the rocks will help things dry.  I lay out my sleeping bag too to try to get some of the dampness out of it from the night before.</p>

<p>Things do dry a bit and then it starts to sprinkle.  I run around as quickly as I can and grab everything that's lying about.  The sleeping bag goes in the tent and the clothes back in the dry bag.  Now it's not a sprinkle and more like rain so I put the garbage bag over my pack and head into the tent to escape the rain.  Now, it's really raining, but this time (unlike last night), my tent is set up and I'm dry.</p>

<p>I inflate my sleeping pad, lay out my sleeping bag and lie there listening to the rain.  It's coming down pretty hard now.  There's still daylight and I haven't eaten dinner yet so I start to plot out what I'll do about dinner if it doesn't stop raining.  I did grab the stove and my dinner food and I have them with me at the tent.  I have a left-over hot chocolate that I didn't drink this morning so I'm thinking that I'll fire up the stove under the beak of my tent (but outside the tent), heat up the water for hot chocolate and at least enjoy that while it's raining.  If I really have to, I could do the same for my red beans &amp; rice.  The stove isn't working real well tonight as this particular stove doesn't seem to like being much over 10,000' and we're almost at 11,000', but eventually the water heats up and I very much enjoy my spiced hot chocolate.  It's all premixed of some really premium powdered chocolate, soy milk powder and a number of spices including cayenne (the absolute best recipe for hot chocolate you could imagine).</p>

<p>Just as I start to think I'm going to have to use the same procedure for the beans and rice, the rains stops and I emerge from the tent.  This time I figure I better get the beans and rice going on getting hydrated (it takes almost 30 minutes) right away.  I do that and then grab my camera because the clouds and setting sunlight are playing all sorts of tricks on the various peaks around us.  The unique lighting is sometimes not all that easy to capture, but I'm playing around trying to see what I can get.</p>

<p>One of my neighbors comes out of their tent too and we're all just watching the lightshow on the mountains and chatting about our trip.  They're also working on the whole JMT at a bit slower pace than me.  I don't know the exact relationship of this couple (elderly guy and gal), but they came to the trail together and they camp together (in the same tent), but they don't necessarily hike together during the day - they each go their own pace and meet up at camp in the evenings.  They may see each other during the day and hike together part of it, but they don't endeavor to keep with each other during the day - an interesting arrangement.  I guess they get to make their own pace during the day, but have company at night in camp.  After about 30 minutes, it's starting to get dark, my beans and rice is ready to eat and it starts to rain again.  I'm back in the tent and eating my beans and rice as carefully as I can trying not to get any in the tent (don't want to be attracting bears into the tent).  Dinner tastes great.  When I finish eating, I venture out in the rain to button up things for the night and get the remnants of my dinner out of the tent.  After a very long day, it's a quick sleep as the rain is coming down on the tent.</p>

<p>I should add that the previous night's rain storm taught me several things about how to set up this tent for rain and tonight, I adjusted my center hiking pole to be significantly lower than before.  This lets the tarp spread out to a much wider distance (lower and wider) and it makes it much, much easier for the edges of the tarp to cover the edges of the internal ground cloth.  Further, I knew that the back two edges of the tent need to be really taught to support that edge and keep it out beyond the ground cloth.  OK, this time I've got it nailed for rain and it's working great.  The only downside to this arrangement is that the whole tent is lower and the ends where my feet and head are located are quite a bit lower.  In fact it's a bit hard to keep my feet in the sleeping bag away from the roof of the tent, but if I position things just right maybe I can do it.</p>

<p><h3>A Pivotal Day</h3>
I don't really realize it at the moment, but this day was a pivotal day.  The weather was bad, it rained morning and night, nearly all my clothes started out wet, yet I climbed more than 3500' with my 38 lb pack loaded with 9 days of food.  This was the big test.  This was the day that measured whether I could do the big peaks of the southern half of the JMT by myself.  If I could survive today (which I did!), the rest should be doable.  It wasn't easy.  I really felt the weight of the pack on the longer steep sections and numerous times had to stop to both readjust how the weight was being carried and rest my core.  But, because I made such big progress today, I only had another 1000' to Muir Pass (11,955') the next day which should be more than doable and I can easily get over in the morning before the (now regular) afternoon thunderstorms.</p>

<p>And Sapphire Lake is such a gorgeous place to camp.
