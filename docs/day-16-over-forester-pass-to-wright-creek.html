<p>Slept well, but woke up early - probably a sign of nerves about going over Forester Pass.  Everything was soaking wet from the rain, including a couple items on the laundry line.  I wrung them out as well as I could and, at the last minute before leaving camp, I put on my wet hiking shirt.  Ohhh that's a bit cold this time in the morning, but I'm sure I'll be warm enough while hiking.  I leave camp by 7:30 and I pass a number of other campers who haven't left camp yet.  It feels like I might be the first one up Forester this morning from this side as I can't see anyone else.  Sometimes, I think I see maybe one other set of boot prints in the freshly smoothed soil on the trail, but I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p>The first three miles of the day isn't too steep and heads up a long valley.  There's water in little streams everywhere (from the rain) including frequently running down the trail which from time to time annoys me because it's hard enough to handle the steepness and altitude, but often you can't even walk normally in the trail because you're trying to keep your boots dry and out of the little streams.  Oh well, just one more thing to deal with and it doesn't last that long.</p>

<p>My body feels fine today, but my feet are getting a bit beat up.  I've got a blister forming on my heel from the roughed up and torn padding in the heel of my boot and my little toe is getting downright painful even though it was already taped up.  I decide that I need to stop and try something different to take care of the feet.  I just have 3 days left here so I need to not let anything get out of hand in that time.  I take the tape off the little toe and can see that it's no longer doing what it used to as the tape has softened up and it's still letting the toe get pinched by its neighbor.  I put a fresh tape job on it, hoping that the newer stiffer tape will protect it more.  For the new blister forming on the heel, I put a special heel bandaid on it and then cover the area with baby powder to help it slip between sock and bandaid.  It may seem odd to promote slipping, but all you're trying to prevent is slipping between skin layers (that's what causes the blister) so if you can promote slipping anywhere between the outer layers to take the pressure off the skin layers (bandaid to sock or sock to sock or even sock to shoe) then you're good so that's what I'm trying to do.  When I lace back up and start hiking, the heel feels good immediately, but the toe is still pretty sore.  A new tape job on the toes never feels comfortable right away so I'll have to see how the next hour goes.</p>

<p>The trail up to Forester follows a stream until the last two miles and there's water pretty close to the other side of Forester so there's really no need to store up water.  I stop to drink and notice that what had been a perfectly clear blue sky when I awoke is already making some dark clouds - wow that was quick.  It's like the coolness of the evening cools things down so much that it dumps all the water out of the clouds at night and then at dawn, there are no clouds at all, but as soon as it starts to warm up again, clouds start forming right away and the cycle starts over again.  I don't know if that's exactly why it does this, but it seems like a plausible explanation.</p>

<p>As I start to get higher, it starts to get cold.  The air temperature is dropping and there's a very cold wind.  This is definitely the coldest it has been during the day on the entire trip.  It's a bit hard to follow exactly where I am on the map until I hit a giant switchback (nearly 1/2 mile long) which stands out on the map.  The trail goes up a valley and then the giant switchback does a nearly 180 degree turn and takes up up onto the top of a ridge and then the trail goes up that ridge until it gets just below Forester where it turns into switchbacks to get up and over Forester.  When I hit the ridge at 10am, it is downright cold.  For the first time, the entire trip, I put on my jacket for hiking, zip on the long pants and put the buff on under my hat.  It feels like maybe 40 degrees with wind.</p>

<p>The trail over Forester Pass was the last part of the JMT built and I've heard it's a well built trail.  While there are sections that are heavy on boulders and giant steps, for the most part they're right.  Given the terrain they need to get up, it's a pretty reasonable grade.  It starts to get steep near the top with some back and forth switchbacks and once again, I decide that it's just demoralizing to keep looking up to try to figure out how much further I have to go.  Instead, I shift into low gear and go at that speed that I could just keep going all day at and this time it works.  My legs feel so much better today than yesterday so I'm able to just keep plodding away and by 11am I'm on top of Forester Pass all by myself (except for the Marmots who are just waiting for me to leave some food unattended).  The south side of Forester is not such a gentle climb as the trail is literally carved into the side of the mountain and after a short while two guys come up that way (looking pretty beat).</p>

<p>At this point, I can see more and more weather building and I'm feeling like I should probably start getting lower soon so I don't get caught in it.  I go down the steepest part of the initial descent into an upper basin with a couple lakes that is still above 12,000' and I can hear significant thunder off in the distance.  My foot could use some maintenance, but I really don't want to stop as I still feel pretty exposed up this high so I'm moving pretty much as fast as I can.  Then, it gets even colder and starts to hail.  They're small soft hailstones that almost look like snow as I catch some in my hand.  I stop to put on my rain jacket, put away some socks I was trying to dry and put a garbage bag over my pack to try to stay dry.  When it's this cold, it seems even more important to stay dry.  For the next hour, the weather is just nasty - hailing intermittently, big gusts of wind and really cold.  If it was a nice sunny day, I'd stop anywhere along here and take a long break to eat, drink and relax because I don't have to make a lot of miles today, but stopping is not entering my mind because it wouldn't be all that enjoyable and I want to get lower.  There's a huge thunderstorm happening to the south and east, right where I imagine Mt. Whitney to be with booms of thunder every few minutes.  I'm thinking to myself that probably nobody is going up Whitney today.</p>

<p>If I can get to the forest at Tyndall Creek, at least I won't be so exposed to the wind.  At one point the garbage bag blows off the top of my pack and I have to run after it in boots and with pack to try to catch it in the wind.  It gets held up by a little bush and I'm able to retrieve it and get it on the pack a little better.  After that episode, a couple guys I've seen several times and chatted with (including on top of Forester) catch up to me and we all hike together.  When we get to the trail junction to Lake South America, we all realize that we're now on map #1, the last map in our set!  A lot of people doing the JMT buy a 13 map set from Harrison maps that is made just for the JMT.  Map #1 is the last map that covers from just north of Tyndall Creek (where we are at the moment) to Whitney and down to Whitney Portal.  Wow, we're definitely on the last segment of the JMT.</p>

<p>It's a short distance further to Tyndall Creek and we seem to have gotten a bit of a reprieve from the weather so the three of us decide to stop here to rest, eat and drink.  I call Steph just to let her know I made it over Forester, but the connection is lousy and we can't really have much of a conversation.   She confirms that the weather is supposed to clear up starting tomorrow so hopefully we'll have good weather for Whitney.  Food and rest were definitely needed and I also go to work on my bad toe trying some bandaids and different tape wrapped a different way.  This is a long stop, but finally I decide to move on.  I could camp here as it's only 11 miles to Guitar Lake (the next night's camping spot), but it's still early afternoon so I figure I'll get a bit closer.  There aren't a lot of choices for upcoming campsites with water, but I set my sites on a small lake up on Bighorn Plateau and if that doesn't work out, there are a couple creeks beyond it that would probably work.</p>

<p>There's more up and down to this next section of trail than I realized from the map (a common happening on this trip) and I'm not enjoying the "up" parts.  I get to where I can see that small lake and it doesn't look like a great place to camp as it's a high plain with absolutely zero protection from the elements so I press on.  The outlet from this lake should be crossing the trail a couple of times and maybe those would offer a place to camp.  I never do see this outlet creek (it must not be flowing) and eventually I get to Wright Creek.  This is definitely where I'm going to camp because I really don't want to go any further and we're now in a wooded area and the creek has plenty of water in it.  I grab the first camp site I find and I relish being in camp by 4pm with the sun out.  For awhile, I just soak up some sun and relax, then I do some laundry, hang it up to dry and pull my tent out to dry too.  It's been a long while since I've had a sunny afternoon in camp.</p>

<p>The other guys I was hiking with earlier in the day arrive and camp nearby and we chat for awhile.  I don't see anyone else go by the rest of the day so most folks must have stopped back at Tyndall Creek.</p>

<p>The evening is relaxing and uneventful which is nice for a change.
