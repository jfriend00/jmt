<p>This whole notion of hiking the John Muir Trail was originally suggested to Pete and I by a friend of ours, Joe Eyre, a couple years before.  Joe suggested it in an email, we had a brief conversation about it then and then the idea sat for awhile.  I don't honestly remember exactly how a discussion of the JMT came about again, but I latched onto it because I felt the need for a major physical endeavor that I could use to motivate me to train and get myself into shape.  I used to use running races (marathons, half-marathons) for those kinds of goals, but it's been awhile since my body has let me run so I was in search of other types of challenges.  The JMT seemed like both an amazing thing to do and certainly an enormous physical challenge to prepare for.  I wanted others to go with me so in late summer of 2012, I started talking to Pete and Joe about it.  Joe was already committed to the Trans Pac sailboat race for the summer of 2013 so he couldn't do it that year.  Pete wasn't really sure.  I remember one back and forth conversation in the late summer with Pete where he was discussing the fact that he's never been backpacking for even remotely that long and he wondered if he would enjoy that.  We briefly discussed maybe doing a "trial" backpack trip in the Sierras in the fall before it got too cold and I had a couple candidate hikes around Mammoth, but when we tried to find a weekend we could do it before the Sierra winter set in, we couldn't make it happen.</p>

<p>The idea gestated for awhile over the winter and somewhere along the line Corey found out about it and got interested.  Pete seemed to decide that if Corey wanted to do it, then Pete would do it with him.  OK, we had a tentative threesome for the hike.  None of us really knew what we were doing, but we could at least start learning about it and figuring out how to plan a trip.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, the JMT is such a milestone hike that there are lots of web resources and several books that make it easier to get educated.  There was also a Yahoo discussion group devoted to the hiking the JMT which proved to be very useful.  The basic idea of the discussion group is that people who haven't a clue what they're doing (us) read and ask questions and people who have done the hike before answer the questions.  In addition, there's a treasure trove of previously posted information such as pack lists, resupply options, etc... that really helps.  So, we started to get ourselves educated.</p>

<p>After deciding if you want to do the whole hike or a section and whether you're going northbound or southbound, the next major step is to get a wilderness permit that allows you to enter the trail where you choose to start and then to camp along the trail.  This, as it turns out, is not an easy thing.  As of our trip, there was no such a thing as a “John Muir Trail permit” as it's actually a trail that goes through many different jurisdictions (the process is a bit different now).  Instead, you would get a permit for the trailhead that you are entering on, you list the trailhead you are exiting on and how many days you will be in the wilderness area.  Once you enter and get past your first night, you're pretty much free to go anywhere in the connected wilderness areas for the duration of your permit.</p>

<p>To give you an idea how much the JMT was growing in popularity from year to year, here are a couple charts:</p>

<p><h3>Getting our Permit</h3></p>

<p>We wanted to start at the Yosemite end of the trail in the middle of the summer which is perhaps one of the most competitive trailhead permits in the country.  As of 2012, there were two ways to get a Yosemite wilderness  permit.  1) Exactly 24 weeks before you want the permit to start, you could fax in a permit request and they will hold a drawing to decide who gets the available permits or 2) You could show up the day you want to start or the day before you want to start at a wilderness permit office in Yosemite and try to get a walk-up permit.  40% of the available permits are reserved for walk-ups plus unclaimed permits from the day before are also awarded to walk-ups.  As it turns out, if you really understand how the system works and you optimize when you show up at the permit office (which we did not really understand at the time), you can generally get a walk-up permit, but you have to be willing to potentially wait a day or two until you score the right permit.  We decided to try the 24 weeks in advance method and we were hoping that perhaps we could get a mid-week entry that might not be as contested.  Yosemite wilderness permits are describe in more detail here.  Pete and I each prepared our own application forms (figuring we'll try twice each day) and faxed them in the night before the first day we were trying for.  Didn't get anything.  Tried again - nothing.  Tried again - nothing.  For the whole first week, we tried and got nothing.</p>

<p>Finally, I called the permit office and asked them if we were doing it right.  They said, oh yeah you're doing it right, but there are very few of the permits you're asking for available and lots of people applying.  You probably need to expand the trailheads you're asking for.  We studied the various options and added a few more ways that you can start out that still start at the beginning of the JMT (Happy Isles trailhead in Yosemite).  Several more days go by and neither of us has gotten anything.  OK, now it's getting serious.  We can't seem to get a permit.  We're getting near the middle of July for a start and if Corey heads off to college in the fall of 2013 (we don't know his college plans yet), he might need to be ready to go by mid-August and this is potentially a 3 week trip.</p>

<p>With a little more research, we find that there are other ways to get to the JMT in Yosemite besides just the official start of the JMT at Happy Isles.  Some involve going a little out of your way the first day, but by the 2nd day you're back on the JMT and the only part you would miss is a part we've all done before.  OK, let's put some of those trailheads on our application.  Bingo, that worked the first time.  We applied for a permit entering at Glacier Point on July 19th and heading to the Illilouette Valley and exiting four weeks later at Whitney Portal.  I got an email confirming the permit reservation that day.  OK, Illilouette Valley is not in the direction of the JMT and Glacier Point isn't the start of the JMT, but we could go into Illilouette Valley the first night and then connect up to the JMT at the top of Nevada Falls the next day (just missing the first 4 miles of the JMT).  At least we can now do the JMT (or 99% of it).</p>

<p>With this plan here’s how our first day would be:</p>
<div>
<img class="photo" src="images/glacier-point-day-1.png">
</div>
<p>We would start at Glacier Point, head down to Illilouette Falls, then up onto the Panorama Trail and find a legal place to camp (that has to be at least 1 mile from the Panorama Trail).  The following day, we can join back up with the actual JMT at Nevada Falls.</p>

<p>A few days later, I get in the U.S. Mail a letter confirming our permit reservation!  I open it just to see what it is, but don't pay much attention to the detail in it until several months later when I realize that it says July 13th, not July 19th.  Hmmm, I wonder why they changed the date? Oh well, that's not a problem - earlier is probably better anyway so we'll aim for leaving on July 13th which is a Saturday.  As it turns out, we were very lucky to be leaving on the 13th, not the 19th - that part of the story will unfold later.</p>

<p>OK, we have a permit for four and we have three hikers.  We'll ask around if anyone else wants to join us.  Eventually Pete finds a friend of his from scouting (that I also know) Richard Contreras who wants to join.  He can't do the whole hike, but he'll plan on going to Red's Meadow (the first 6 days).</p>

<p>FYI, the JMT permit system is different now than it was for us  as now they make more of a distinction between permits for through hikers like us vs. local hikers who are just hiking in Yosmite (which makes sense).</p>
