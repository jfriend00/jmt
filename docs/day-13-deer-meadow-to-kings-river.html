<p>The approach to Mather Pass is called the Golden Staircase.  That's apparently for two reasons.  First off and most importantly to me, it's a steep approach to the pass.  Even the run-up several miles before the pass is steep.  Secondly, around sunset apparently the whole area can turn a golden color.  I don't get to see that golden color, but I do get to see the staircase itself.  I hit the trail at 7:30 and very soon run into the staircase, steep switchbacks that rise 1400' in less than two miles.  It takes all of ten minutes and some serious burning in my glutes for me to realize that this might be a very long day.  Perhaps due to the long mileage I did yesterday, I just don't have a lot of energy today.  I take frequent short breaks to let the burn in my glute muscles subside, but I'm definitely having more trouble today than I have any previous day.  Eventually I rediscover/remember that if I over crank my waist belt to try to get more weight on my hips that this causes the glute burn so I ease off on the waist belt and take some more weight on my shoulders.  This helps with the glute burn, but not with the overall energy level.</p>

<p>Finally, I make it up the first part of the staircase and get to the first Pallisade Lake.  There are a number of folks camped here and and they're packing up to head up Mather too.  As I'm hiking along the lakes I see the father/son pair that Diane had been hiking with (they're filling water bottles at the lake) and chat with them for a little while.  I then stop myself and purify and drink a liter of water.  According to the transcriptions on my map, there should be another good water source up a few more miles so I decide not to carry much water up the next part of the ascent.  The trail starts climbing immediately as it goes far above the second Pallisade lake.  Here I encounter a number of CCC (California Conservation Corp) people working on the trail.  They appear to only have a shovel and a huge crowbar and they're working in pairs and slowly moving large boulders around to either get them out of the trail or shore up something that got damaged in the last winter.  It looks like back breaking, very slow work.   The crew is split evenly male/female with one crew chief overseeing the operation.  I'm wondering to myself where these folks are based (where they sleep) and how they get food because we're a long ways from anything other than a campsite.  Perhaps they are just camping out here like us and someone else is hiking in supplies.</p>

<p>I get past the Pallisade Lakes and up another 600' and come across a major creek.  This is probably the last major water source before the pass.  I'll fill up here and make sure I have enough to get over the pass.  I get my water, drink some of it and I'm simply exhausted.  The day is just getting started and I feel like I'm ready for a nap.  I lay down on a flat rock, put my hat over my face and close my eyes.  I don't actually fall asleep, but I don't exactly feel like moving either.  As I'm laying there the father/son catches up to me again and they sit down too.  OK, I guess it's time to get up again and go.  The legs don't really want to, but it's just another 900' up and 1-2 miles.  The map shows serious switchbacks which I've heard are steep, but I don't actually know how tough they are.  This section seems like it takes a long time.  It's another one of those passes where you can't quite tell where you're going and thus can't really tell how much further to the top.  This trail is steep with lots of big things to step up and loose rocks making for unsure footing.  On top of that, I'm still feeling real low on energy.  I've been doling out my mid-day food during the climb, but today I just don't have much energy.</p>

<p>I finally get to the top of Mather Pass and am rewarded with one of the best views in both directions.  I called Steph from the sat phone figuring that maybe it would work better from the top of a pass instead of inside a deep valley.  Yes and no.  We manage a conversation, but still get disconnected a few times.  I'm starting to figure it out.  If you watch the signal strength indicator and initiate a call right when it goes to max signal strength, then you can usually talk for a few minutes before it starts having connection issues.  I take the photos I want and eat some more lunch and then start down the other side.</p>

<p>The southern side of Mather is completely different from the northern side.   It's a steep descent for only about 600' and then you're in what they call Upper Basin, very gently sloped downhill.  By all measures, this should be an easy part of the hike - gentle downhill.  Unfortunately for me, I just have no energy.  My body just keeps telling me to stop hiking and lay down.  At a couple little creeks, I do exactly that.  I actually try to take a little nap figuring I just need to recover some more from the previous day.  But, stopping and resting does not help at all.  Something different is going on.  The plan when I was reviewing the maps the night before was to cross Kings River and then climb up the switchbacks and camp around the turn off to Bench Lake.  Fortunately Mather Pass and Pinchot Pass are not that far apart so I don't have to put in a long day today.</p>

<p>The slow descent through Upper Basin and then down to the Kings River (6.5 miles) seems to take forever.  That's probably partly because I am going slow and taking lots of rest stops, but also I just really don't have it today. I finally get down to Kings River and it takes some work to find a way across the river without having to wade through it.  When I finally do get across, I find myself walking through the campsite of the other father/son from Indiana that we saw much, much earlier in the trip.  We chat for awhile and they mention that a lot of the campsites here are already taken, but if I want to camp next to them that's fine with them.  That wasn't my original plan (I was going to go further), but seeing how little energy I have today and that Pinchot Pass isn't that far away tomorrow, I decide I'll just camp here.  It's also threatening rain so I set up my tent right away and climb in.  I lay down and try to take another nap.  I don't fall asleep, but even though it's not cold out at all, I get completely chilled and need my jacket.  Something odd is definitely going on.  After awhile of not feeling any better, I decide I'll cook dinner.  It's a spaghetti and hot chocolate night.  I start with the hot chocolate and then it takes nearly 30 minutes for dinner to be ready to eat and I scarf it down.  I probably could have eaten three dinners if someone handed them to me.</p>

<p>Within 15 minutes after eating, I suddenly feel fine again.  I'm not cold.  I don't feel tired.  I wander over and chat with my neighbors.  How odd?  Is it possible that the super long 18+ mile day yesterday just took so much out of me that I really just didn't have enough calories today?  If that's the case, then my body was trying to feverishly burn fat to fill in the deficit, but it just couldn't keep up with the demand so it kept sending my brain signals to stop and lay down.  Probably what it was really trying to do was to just stop burning more calories and what I probably really needed was to just eat more food.</p>

<p>I have gotten really good on this trip at eating everything allocated for a day (all 3000 calories and 100g of protein), so this wasn't a case of ignoring the food I'd brought.  Perhaps this was a case of burning 6000 calories while just consuming 3000.  If you've ever been a long distance runner, you may know the term "bonk" where the body just runs out of readily available fuel for the muscles and you just can't bring yourself to run any more.  I've experienced that while training for a marathon before and this is kind of what the day was like.  It wasn't quite as sudden as it sometimes happens to runners, but the whole day kind of felt that way.  I didn't piece this scenario together right away, but I think that a very long day the day before combined with a hard pass today and a still somewhat heavy pack just left me with too big a calorie deficit and my body didn't handle it well (I'm sure it did burn some fat, but couldn't do so quick enough).</p>

<p>I'm certainly not an expert on this, but I looked for some explanation of what could have been happening online when I got back.  I've since read about how the body stores glycogen (for energy) in both muscles (for use in that muscle) and in the liver (for distribution to where it's needed).  When endurance athletes talk about "carbing up" before an event, they're trying to make sure their glycogen stores are full.  But, when you're on the 13th day of an athletic endeavor like this and burning more calories per day than you take in, you end up burning up most of the "spare" glycogen.  So, day to day, you have to either consume the desired calories to fuel your muscles or you have to get the energy from some other source like burning fat.  If your glycogen stores aren't depleted, the body can rely on the stores and you can handle a short term caloric intake deficit more easily.  But, when the stores are empty, some people just can't burn fat quickly enough to keep them going if they aren't taking in enough quick burning calories.  That's a "bonk".</p>

<p>Anyway, I make a mental note that I might need to either slow down or dip into future day's food if this problem happens again.</p>

<p>Since I'm feeling so much better after dinner, I decide to do some laundry and to take a bath in the river.  The sun has already gone behind a mountain, but I want to find that "clean" feeling again before crawling in my sleeping bag so I wander down to the river and manage to get most of the way in (brrr).  While I don't enjoy the cold, it sure is worth it when I crawl into my sleeping bag feeling clean.</p>

<p>Tomorrow's push over Pinchot Pass shouldn't be too bad (it's not that far away), but Glen Pass is a long ways from Pinchot so I'm going to try to push a long day again to get as close to Glen Pass as I can.  Looking at the map, I'd like to get up to Dollar Lake as that would get me within 5 miles of Glen Pass.  We'll see how it goes and how the energy goes.
