<h2>Day 18 - Guitar Lake to Whitney and Down to Whitney Portal</h2>
<img class="photo" src="images/day-18-map.png">
<p>16mi - climb 3000', descend 6200'
I wake up at 5:30am and apparently my watch alarm didn't go off as planned.  I spring into action and start packing up.  Since we're in the shadow of Mt. Whitney, there won't be any sun here for a long time, but it is starting to get light though it's quite cold.  I grab the food for the day and put it in my pack side pocket (my normal procedure) and stuff a couple items for breakfast in my pocket.  In the quickest pack job of the day, I hit the trail just a few minutes after 6 just as the sun is hitting the mountains far to the west.  It's cold out, perhaps in the high 30s.  I'm hiking in my long sleeve shirt with no jacket because I think I'll get warm when the trail gets steep, but it's still kind of cold.</p>

<p>My goal here for this next 3000' and few hours is to try to find that magic pace that I can just go without stopping or resting.  I have plenty of time today (I've calculated it out many times) so I don't have to rush and if I get behind schedule a little bit on the ascent, I can just take a shorter break on the top of Whitney.  So, the goal is slow and steady.  I pass a couple about my age and they're stopping every hundred yards or so to take a break.  It's still mostly dark on my side of Whitney so I'm not tempted to take any photos.  I figure the photos will be better later in the day when the sun gets up.  The first mile and half is a steady ascent, but no switchbacks.  I'm trying to figure out where the trail goes, but I can't really tell again.  Then, I start the switchbacks.  Each segment is a long switchback (maybe 1/4 mile) and slowly I can tell I'm getting higher and higher.  I've eaten my planned breakfast and I grab another energy bar.  I don't really want to stop, but it's hard to keep up with the heavy breathing while also eating so I have to take a few pauses while eating.</p>

<p>There's not a whole lot of story to tell for the rest of the climb.  I keep thinking I see where were going and then find out that's not it until at last I can see a bunch of gear piled up in a spot.  Hmmm, I bet that is Trail Junction where through-hikers drop a bunch of gear for the side trip to Whitney.  As I get closer I can see that that is what it is and I'm almost there.  At Trail Junction, my plan is to unload my bear container, my tent and sleeping bag and any clothes I don't need and leave them there while I do the 2 mile side trip to Whitney.  I'll leave the bear container out by itself and put all the other items in a garbage bag that I'll tie up to discourage anyone from walking off with anything (not too likely to happen this far from civilization, but might as well be careful).  When I stop at Trail Junction, I realize that I'm freezing.  Rather than the day warming up as you would expect, it has just gotten colder as I've gone up in altitude.  There are puddles on the trail here that are frozen solid so it was really cold last night.  I put on my jacket, gloves and buff and make sure to bring the rest of my warm clothes with me and head off on the side trail to Whitney and the completion of the JMT.  Wow, what a lightweight pack when you unload the things I took out!  I estimated later than I probably unloaded 10 pounds which gave me a nice light pack.</p>

<p>It dawns on me that my toe wrap is working great - no pain from the vicinity of that toe and my heel bandages seem to be holding too so, for now, my feet are doing well.  The two mile trek to Whitney seems like it should be no big deal.  It's a 1000' rise over 2 miles and I have a light pack.  But the catch is that I've already come up 3000' and we're now in the lesser oxygen of above 13,000.  In reality, it isn't too bad.  Nothing on that section of trail is particularly steep, but parts of it are nothing but rocks piled on top of one another and it takes a lot of concentration and balance to place your feet for every step.  And, it's ridiculously cold.  I'm not sure how cold, but I do see the frozen solid puddles in places so obviously it was well below freezing last night.  It would be nice to have some sunshine, but we're covered by low clouds.  I can see the early bird day hikers on the trail too and I'm figuring that they must have started really early (perhaps 3am).  I climbed up 3000' this morning, but they climbed up 5600' to get to Trail Junction from Whitney Portal.</p>

<p>The rest of the segment up to Whitney is uneventful.  It's mostly just cold and I just want it to be done.  In all honesty, if the JMT didn't actually go to the top of Whitney, I might have just skipped going to Whitney itself and just headed down.  The weather isn't very good and I've seen it before and I'd really like to be all the way down.  But, it's part of the JMT and is still always amazing to see the view from there.</p>

<p>When I arrive at Whitney around 9:15am, there are probably 10 other people up there, but there's a steady stream of people arriving behind me.  I don't recognize anyone from the JMT so I'm assuming most of these are dayhikers.  I'm almost an hour ahead of my plan so I can take as long as I want up top.  The low clouds are just barely above our elevation so you can't see a whole lot in very many directions.  You can see the town of Lone Pine down below and it's almost hard to imagine that it's more than 10,000 feet below.  I will hopefully be down there soon.  I pull out the sat phone and send my obligatory GPS position showing me on top of Whitney.  By prearrangement, that would be my signal to Steph that I was on top and I told her I'd call her later from Trail Camp to confirm whether I was coming all the way down today or not.
In the whirlwind of getting here, it doesn't dawn on me immediately, but I've finished the JMT!  In some ways, it seems like a bit of a hollow victory though because I've still got 11 miles and 6200' of descending to go to get back to civilization.  Oh well, I'll take it anyway, even though there's still a long day ahead.</p>

<p>Mindful of making sure I get enough food today, I sit down and make myself eat some trail mix and drink some water.  If the sun was out, I'd love to just lay here and soak up some sun, but it's way too cold for that.  Fortunately, the clouds start to lift a bit and we can see much more than before.  Still plenty cold, but at least now we can see.  I run through my head a list of things I want to do up here that I didn't do last time and that includes taking some panoramas, some video and some shots with me in them.  After a little rest and some food, I feel pretty good and I'm not nearly as tired or oxygen-starved as I was when I was up here four years ago with Kevin.  Better training, more control of calories and more than two weeks at high altitude have made a big difference.</p>

<p>After taking all the photos I want, I sign my name in the guestbook and start my way back down around 10:15.  I arrived on top an hour ahead of schedule, but stayed 30 minutes longer than planned so I'm still 30 minutes ahead of the plan.
OK, now it's kind of just drudgery as this is a long, long ways down and there's nothing new to see (I've done this before).  The stretch back to Trail Junction where I left my gear goes relatively quickly and takes a little over an hour.  There's now a lot of gear piled up at Trail Junction which I guess is a crude measure of how many people are finishing the JMT today - by my estimation, maybe 10 people's gear here and maybe some people both ahead of and behind me so a crude guess would be 20 people finishing today.  That seems to line up with about how many people were camped at Guitar Lake too.</p>

<p>When I get back to Trail Junction, I reload all my gear back into my pack (takes a little while) and woahhhh, this sucker feels heavy.  The downside of taking a light pack for four miles is that when you then have to put the full weight pack back on, suddenly it feels a lot heavier.  Oh well, hopefully I'll get used to it and it will once again feel like a fairly light version of my JMT pack (since I only have 1-2 days worth of food left).  From Trail Junction, it's a couple hundred feet climb to Trail Crest where you go over the top of the Whitney ridge and start going down to the east.  I arrive at Trail Crest at 11:40.  OK, I have 5+ hours to go 9 miles.  I normally averaged 2 mph on the JMT so that should be no problem, even though much of this is steep descent. The last time I was up here at Trail Junction with Kevin, there was 20 feet of snow here and we glisaded down to Trail Camp.  This time, the area where we glisaded is nothing but boulders and instead there are 99 switchbacks and 1600' between here and Trail Camp.  I guess that part will actually be a new experience, not a particularly fun experience, but new.</p>

<p>I switch into "descend mode", something I've gotten pretty good at on the JMT.  The heart doesn't have to work very hard, but the brain does have to work hard to find the right spot for every new footstep.  I'm passing a lot of people going down the switchbacks and making good progress.  I tell myself that this isn't a race.  Steph probably won't get to Whitney Portal until sometime around 5pm anyway so there's no need to unduly rush and I certainly don't want to take a fall.  But, I would certainly like to get down and that sense seems to just get stronger as the day goes on.
I get down to Trail Camp and it's like a mini-ghost town.  There are some tents set up, but nobody is around.  Everyone who camped here the night before is above me on the trail to/from Whitney.  I find a good place to sit and take a break and I call Steph to confirm with here that I'm coming all the way down today.  I'll see her in 4 hours or so.  Six miles to go and I know that Kevin and I descended from here with heavy packs in three hours so there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do the same (or faster).</p>

<p>Again mindful of eating to keep up my energy, I eat most of the rest of the food I have for lunch and drink a bunch of water.  I'm suddenly aware that, because of how cold it was, I haven't drank very much today so I drink some more.  Now, it's off for the last part of the descent.  I logically think of the descent from here in three pieces.  There's the first part out of trail camp which is very rocky, a bit treacherous and steep and just about forced Kevin and I to stop when we were coming up.  There's the middle part which passes through Trail Camp and has stretches of rocky and steep, but also has stretches of more gradual gravel covered trail.  And, there's the last part where you can actually see Whitney Portal below and the trail is mostly gravel/dirt and not very technical.  I'll attack the descent in those three logical pieces to kind of break it up for me.</p>

<p>As I descend on the steepest part from Trail Camp, memories of coming up this section with Kevin come flooding back.  In our eagerness and excitement over the trip, we basically ascended too quickly and completely exhausted ourselves.  We had all day to get to Trail Camp and didn't need to push ourselves that hard.  We should have taken 30-45 minute rests and we should have eaten more.  Anyway, that trip turned out to teach me a few really important lessons that helped me a lot on the JMT.  I never would have guessed that a 2-night backpack trip four years earlier would have taught me a bunch of useful things for an 18-day trip on the JMT, but it did.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first set of miles go fairly quickly, I make it down to Mirror Lake and then to Outpost Camp.  I'm surprised to see tons of people camped at Outpost Camp and I'm surprised how hot it's gotten too.  Outpost Camp has a great water source, but not a lot of shade and there's going to be a ton of dayhiker traffic so I wouldn't have though it was a great place to camp, but nevertheless there are a lot of people that seem to have a different opinion.  Outpost Camp marks around the halfway point of the descent from Trail Camp and it's a little bit above 10,000' with the Whitney Portal destination at 8365'.  I'm almost there.</p>

<p>My little toe that had so miraculously been cured by my moleskin wraps earlier in the day has started to really hurt again.  I figure I could just press forward and live with it, but I'm ahead of schedule so I might as well stop and see if I can take care of it again.  When I get my socks off, I can see that the moleskin has mostly slid off the toe and thus it isn't doing its job any more - that would explain things.  I get out the first aid kit and my trusty Swiss Army knife scissors and I fashion a new bandage just like the old one.  It takes me about 20 minutes and then I'm in business again, no pain with that toe.  As long as it stays in place, it works.</p>

<p>The last stretch of the trail is uneventful.  There are a few steep parts and then you get to the point where you can see Whitney Portal down below.  I remember this part from my previous trip.  Whitney Portal looks close, but it's not.  It's at least an hour from when you can see it until you get there.  That actually helps me this time as I'm able to realize exactly how much time I have left rather than constantly wondering why you aren't there yet.  I meet up on this descent with a guy (who's name I can't remember now) that I've been hiking with on and off for the last four days. We go most of the rest of the way down together and the chat helps pass the time too.
At long last, we reach the last major switchback and pop out at the start/end of the Whitney Trail at 4pm.  I'm done hiking!  Yeah!</p>

<p>I just happen to see both Diane and the father/son as they are about to leave Whitney Portal.  The father tells me about their sunrise adventure.  They left camp at 1am and when they got to Trail Junction, they dropped a bunch of heavy things out of their pack like I did and then made it to Whitney for the sunrise, but it was ridiculously cold.  He said that if they had their sleeping bags with them, they could have just crawled in them and been warm enough while waiting for the sunrise, but like me, they had left their sleeping bags at Trail Junction and they just froze.  I could just feel the son thinking "nice move Dad making us freeze".  Diane didn't do the sunrise thing.  She just got her usual early start out of camp.  We say goodbye and I head up to the Whitney Portal store where I have an appointment with a veggie burger, fries and soda.</p>

<p>I'm sitting at a picnic table munching on my delightful veggie burger when I see Steph's car driving around looking for a place to park and then I see Sara coming up the hill.  I wave, they come running up and we exchange long hugs.  Steph takes a long look at me and pronounces that I look like a homeless guy - scruffy beard, disheveled hair, dirty clothes - well you get the picture.  I finish my burger and we drive down to the hotel in Lone Pine where I have an appointment with a very long hot shower, something I haven't had since day 6 of the adventure, 12 days ago.  I'm done hiking!
