<h2>Getting in Shape</h2>

<p>OK, now that we have a date, it all seems more real.  My first order of business is to figure out how to get in shape.  I've had a series of toe and foot injuries over the last year and a half and have had trouble doing any sort of regular fitness activities because of never ending pains and injuries.  It's off to the foot doctor to figure out how I can get my feet well.  Not only do I need to get my feel well so I can start training, but obviously carrying a backpack for 2-3 weeks over difficult terrain is itself going to be awfully hard on my feet.</p>

<p>The doctor's solution is custom orthotics that help spread the load more evenly across the various bones in my very flat feet and hopefully reduce some of the stresses that have caused me foot and toe problems.  That whole process takes quite awhile, but eventually I have some new orthotics and I start the process of breaking them in.  In something that isn't quite so intuitive, you can't just start wearing these new custom orthotics for everything right away.  Even though they are supposed to ultimately be good for your body, you have to let your feet adapt to their new support system.  I work out a gradual plan to phase them in.  After working through that gradual plan, I finally wear them on an 8 mile day hike in the Santa Cruz mountains.  It's just a day hike with no pack, but when I get back from the hike, one of my feet is seriously sore and several days later, it still really hurts.  All thoughts of other training is one hold.  Eventually, I'm back to the foot doctor.  He decides to make a change to one of the orthotics to provide some relief to the area that really hurts.  I can immediately feel some relief, but it's still really sore.   This soreness persists for the next several months (it has good days and bad days) and just when I think that perhaps it isn't getting better fast enough, it finally stops bothering me only about a month before the trip.  There were many times where I wondered if the injury from the custom orthotics had actually torpedoed my chances.</p>

<p>My plan to get in shape consists of four pieces.  1) I'll go on hikes at least twice a week.  The goal is to work up to 10 miles hikes with 2000' of elevation gain with a 35 lb pack.  There's a convenient trail (up Black Mountain) not too far from our house that meets this spec.  2) I'll work out with a personal trainer twice a week to really concentrate on building strength in legs and core.  My left knee/quad is particularly weak.  3) Whenever I play golf (generally twice a week), I'll walk the course and carry my bag (that's essentially a 6 mile walk with a 15-20 lb pack).  4) Lose 10 pounds of weight.  Losing excess body weight is at least as useful as making your pack lighter by that much weight so it's a great way to improve your chances on the trail and lessen the stress on your body.</p>

<p>So, if I do two hikes a week, work with the personal trainer twice a week and play golf twice a week, that's a 6-day a week plan with one rest day.  That will certainly keep me busy.</p>

<p>Except for the interference with my fitness plan due to various injuries, things go pretty well.  It's unbelievable how sore I am after the first few hikes and the first few sessions with the personal trainer.  Basically, I'm in really lousy shape for everything except golf.  My golf game take a nose dive because my body is so sore all the time.  But, as expected, the soreness eases up as I get used to things.  I'm so tired after the first several hikes and first several sessions with the personal trainer that I literally fall asleep when I get home and feel like I can't do much the rest of the day.  I was seriously out of shape.</p>

<p>The gym for the personal trainer helps me with a plan to lose the weight which basically involves focusing only on really healthy food, avoiding lots of foods that have fairly empty calories (like bread) and making sure I get plenty of protein for all the new muscle building activities I'm pursuing.  It's a bit of a challenge to fit my vegan style into their plan, but eventually we make it work.  I lose four pounds in the first couple weeks and two pounds in the next few weeks and eventually get down about eight pounds.  As I'm also adding a fair amount of muscle and need calories to fuel all my activity, I decided that eight pounds is enough weight loss.  Cool, right away that's eight less pounds my legs have to haul over the high passes on the JMT.  Almost as good as taking eight pounds out of my pack.
