<p>
This day is really all about setting up the next day to go over Selden Pass tomorrow.  We've made good enough time the last couple days that it's clear that we're going to make it to Muir Trail Ranch (MTR) from Red's Meadow in 4 days instead of 5 so we've gained a day versus our plan.  The day starts with finishing our descent and going past the turn off to Vermillion Valley Resort (VVR), crossing Mono Creek (another bridge) doing a long, dry (no water) climb up to Bear Ridge, down the other side a bit, pick up Bear Creek and start following it uphill towards Selden Pass and then find a place to camp with water short of the pass.</p>

<p>After our initial descent, when we get to the Mono Creek bridge, we all fill up with water and prepare ourselves for a long 1500' dry climb.  It's forested and we can't really see much so the climb is really kind of boring - just lots of switchbacks and trees.  I feel really strong (didn't feel very good the day before) and we all seem to find a very good pace up the switchbacks where we're making good time, but not needing many stops or breaks.</p>

<p>Somewhat before we know it, the slope starts to level out and the switchbacks are done, signifying that we're done with most of the climb.  A trail junction with the Bear Ridge Trail (which is a shortcut to VVR) tells us exactly where we are and that we're done with the climb.</p>

<p>We now descend into a river valley and as we find a small tributary creek, we stop for water and lunch.  A mile or so later is the much bigger Bear Creek.</p>

<p>For the next several hours, we're following Bear Creek up towards Selden pass.  The mosquitoes are particularly nasty in places and several places we consider stopping for a rest are quickly vetoed by an army of mosquitoes.</p>

<p>When we encounter a place where the trail crosses the river and the mosquitoes aren't too bad, we decide it's time for a swim and some laundry.  After a long hot day, washing off in the river feels very nice even though it's already late afternoon and clouds are blocking the sun.  One can never be sure what you're going to be able to get dry for the next day, but you kind of need to take these opportunities to wash things when you have them.</p>

<p>After our swim/wash diversion, we're back on the trail again and trying to figure out how far we should go before camping.  We get to Rosemarie Meadow and the obvious camp sites are already taken.  We go a little further and there are more camp sites, but they aren't very close to water so we keep going on.  None of us are prepared for a dry camp so we'll either have to find a campsite with water or backtrack back to get enough water.  At this point, I can kind of tell that some of the others wanted to grab an earlier campsite and I was pushing us to go higher.  We finally find a campsite, but aren't sure whether there's satisfactory water nearby.  I look ahead up the trail a little bit more and Pete scopes out the water.  There's nothing better up the trail a little further and Pete reports that there's a small creek about 100 yards away.  We're mostly camping on little sandy spots on top of large slabs of granite - a bit different campsite than we've had before.  In a weird sort of back and forth oscillation, the mosquitoes will be almost completely gone and then 10 minutes later they'll be bad.  After dinner, I'm transcribing water source locations from Pete's Android app onto my printed maps and the mosquitoes are so thick that even with my head net on, I'm having trouble concentrating enough to finish the transcribing.  As the sun goes down, the mosquitoes chase us into our tents to escape them.  Shortly after that, we get short little bits of rain (nothing heavy), but we also see hours of lightning and thunder.  It looks like evening thunderstorms are now the pattern.</p>

<p>I talk to Steph on the sat phone about going on solo and she's OK with it.  I wouldn't say she's happy with it, but she seems more interested in whether I'm confident or not and using that to gauge her opinion.  At one point she asks me to hand the phone to Pete and she quizzes him about how I'm doing.  I can sense that she's a little anxious about it, but if she thinks I'm confident then she'll be OK with it.</p>

<p>It's hard to have this kind of conversation on the sat phone because you regularly get disconnected, the conversation sometimes gets garbled and you never really know if the person on the other end heard everything you said.  I don’t think this is a generic limitation of sat phones, just what happens when you’re surrounded by granite cliffs and you don’t have enough exposure to the sky to stay connected to a satellite long enough until the next satellite comes into view.  It's better than nothing, but still has its limitations.  Anyway, I'm good with going solo and Steph seems OK with that.  I'll talk to her again tomorrow. But, as of going to sleep this night, the plan is for me to proceed on the 2nd half of the hike solo.  I'll take Pete's sat phone with me to have emergency communications and I'll also have to carry my own stove, pot and fuel and maybe grab a couple things out of Pete's first aid kit that I don't have (antibiotic pills).  I already have everything else I need.
