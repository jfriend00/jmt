<h2>Water on the JMT</h2>
<p>What about water on the JMT?  Fortunately, there is plenty of water on the JMT.  While there are a couple 5-6 mile stretches that could be dry in a low snow year (like the year we're going), that's the longest we need to go without water and many parts of the trip are following rivers.  Much of the southern half of the trip goes over a pass (which will be dry near the top), but then forms the headwaters of a river system, follows that river down from the pass and the river gets larger and larger as you go and other things are joining up with it and then when you get to a low point, you turn and follow a tributary up to its headwaters and go over another pass.  In fact, the JMT specifically follows the multiple headwaters of the various forks of the San Joaquin River, the Tuolumne River (which ends up in the Merced River) and the Kings River which are all major rivers flowing into the California Central Valley. With this much water around, you don't have to carry a lot of water during the day.  The largest amount you might have to carry is if you're going from a water source, hiking a ways on a hot day and then dry camping (e.g. camping where there's no water).  While we might be forced into an occasional dry camp by circumstances, the only two dry camps we're planning on are the first two nights in Yosemite with water in between.  The first night is dry for sure - we don't know if the second night is dry or not.  We could probably make due with a  max carrying capacity of two liters (one liter for meals in a dry camp and one liter for hiking to/from water source before/after camp.  But, we all decide to add a super lightweight plastic water bottle that gives us one more liter of carrying capacity if needed.  It weighs less than a half ounce so it's cheap insurance and it's a backup container if something happens to the hydration bladder too.</p>

<p>What about water purification on the JMT? There are many theories and methods here.  I met several people on the JMT that selected water sources carefully and did not purify at all.  They claim they've been successful doing this before.  I simply didn't want to take that risk.  Giardia is known to exist in some of these waters in some places and if you get it, you will have to end your hike as you pretty much can't keep food or hydration down.  It takes up to two weeks for the symptoms to get you, but it sounds pretty nasty to me.  We actually ran into a PCT through hiker in Tuolumne who had gotten Giardia before he got to the Sierras.  It was nasty.  He had to be hospitalized, spent two weeks recovering before he could start hiking again and four weeks later was still not feeling like he had full strength back.  I'd also read stories about some ultramarathoners trying to set JMT speed records who skipped purification for quickness reasons and got Giardia.  Incidentally, once you get Giardia, you have it in your system forever and you actually become a carrier.  Your feces can pollute other water sources and give it to others.</p>

<p>This seems like a place where I wanted zero risk of this.  The main water purification options are filter, chemical treatment or UV (e.g. Steripen).  For various reasons, I had already chosen for previous trips the Steripen UV treatment.  It worked great on the previous trips and it specifically targets things like Giardia.  It seems particularly optimized for Sierra water because the water itself is very clear - you just need to make sure there are no hidden bio nasties in it which the UV light of the Steripen kills.  For those who don't know how a Steripen works, you fill a 1 liter container with water.  You turn on the Steripen and immerse it in the 1 liter of water. You swirl it around for 90 seconds and when the UV light of the Steripen goes off and a resulting green LED comes on, your water has been purified.  You can drink it immediately and it adds no taste.  The only question with the Steripen is how many batteries do you need for it and are you going to bring a backup in case you break the Steripen or it fails for some reason.

<p>As it turns out a single set of the best batteries does more than 50 liters of water so you can plan batteries that way.  For me that meant that one set of batteries worked for the first half of the hike and then I put in a new set at the MTR resupply (the previous batteries were still working) for the second half of the trip.  I was purifying about 5 liters per day (depending upon the weather).  I would generally drink about 3 liters during the day and 2 liters in camp (counting breakfast and dinner cooking and drinking).</p>

<p>We were going to bring purification tablets as a backup, but then Pete just decided he'd get his own Steripen as a backup.  This worked out really nicely because when we hit a water stop, we weren't serialized around one Steripen (we could use both), but if one should fail, we had a backup.  Having redundant/backup supplies like this is one of the advantages of going in a small group of people rather than solo (more on these tradeoffs later).
