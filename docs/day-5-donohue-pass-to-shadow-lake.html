<p>I wake up at 2am to go to the bathroom and see just an incredible view of the stars.  We've been going to sleep pretty early and had a partial moon so we haven't been seeing amazing stars yet, but this time the moon has set and there are simply an unbelievable number of stars.  You can very clearly see the cluster of the milky way and it's all right above the glacier.  I decide that I'm going to try to take some star photos as I'm not sure when else I'll be awake and have this clear a view with no moon.  I get out my mini tripod and start experimenting with how to set the right kind of exposure.  My first challenge is that it's so dark that auto-focus won't work so I need to figure out how to set manual focus to infinity.  This is a new camera and one of the issues with new cameras is that you don't always know how to do all the things you knew how to do with the old camera and this type of manual focus is one of those things.  After a number of experiments, I think that maybe I've figured out the focus, now I need to figure out an exposure.  I discover that my camera will do a maximum of a 30 second timed exposure and at base ISO that isn't enough to see the stars.  I start raising the ISO and eventually discover that at ISO 1600, aperture wide open at f/2.8 and a 30 second exposure, I can see stars.  Actually, I can see small star trails because the stars move a tiny bit in 30 seconds, but I think that's the best I can do.  I fiddle with star shots for nearly an hour and then feel like I need to get back to sleep.  Hopefully some of them came out well.</p>

<p>We get going out of camp at 8:20 and head up Donohue Pass.  I feel really good this morning and the higher we climb up towards Donohue Pass, the better the views get.  We get looks down Lyell Canyon where you can see the river snaking through meadows and we get more and more views of the glacier and related peaks.  I experiment taking some panorama shots that I will stitch together back at home and it seems like every corner we come around begs for more photos.  It takes us a couple hours to climb the 1000' to the pass and when we get over, we can see all sorts of peaks on the other side in the Ansel Adams Wilderness area as we're leaving Yosemite now.  We all pose for the mandatory picture on our first significant pass, we take a food break and Pete discovers that his cell phone works (probably cell towers near Mammoth ski resort) so he talks to Anne and I call Steph.  A marmot takes a liking to Corey's stuff and spends the next 30 minutes stalking his backpack and food items from all possible directions.</p>

<p>After a nice break here, we start the descent.  This is our first serious descent and it's a bit of work.  The trail is well maintained, but there's still large rocks to step down from and things to step over.  As we come down into the Ansel Adam's Wilderness, we can really start to see some of the major features there with the black peaks of the Ritter Range to the west (Mt. Davis and Mt. Ritter), a knife edge ridge to our east  (never did figure out what it's called), June Mountain and Mammoth Mountain where there's skiing in the winter and lakes and rivers pretty much everywhere.</p>

<p>The further down we get, the more people we start to see as this whole area is a very popular summer hiking destination out of Mammoth so there are lots of local backpackers (as opposed to through hikers like us).  We descend 1500' down to a river valley that feeds Waugh Lake and then climb back up a bit to Island Pass (though nobody seems to understand why this deserves to be called a pass).  We then drop down 400' to Thousand Island Lake where we take a swim break to cool down (it's pretty hot out) and rest.</p>

<p>At this point the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) splits from the JMT for about 15 miles and we find out later why.  The JMT goes up/down a lot as it goes from one glacially carved lake to the next.  The PCT follows a relatively level path first to Agnew Meadows and then the two trails meet up again at Red's Meadow.  We come to not enjoy the up/down of this part of the JMT.  Though it's generally only 500' of up/down for each lake, it gets old quickly.  I have a new respect for a 500' climb at the end of a hot day with a heavy backpack.  500' doesn't seem like it should be much, but it's more than you might think.  It's down to Thousand Island Lake, up to Ruby Lake, down to Garnet Lake, then up out of Garnet Lake and so on.  At Garnet Lake, we take a long break (Corey and Pete go swimming) and briefly discuss camping there, but there aren't really very many good places to camp and we'd like to be closer to Red's Meadow.  We run into a father/son from Indiana doing the JMT who missed a trail junction somewhere and we're forced to go way out of their way to get back on the right trail.  They look beat.  The father looks like he's in good shape, but the son (perhaps in his 20s) looks a bit worn out.  They're talking about trying to get to Rosalie Lake to camp, another 4 miles from where we are.  We're aiming for Shadow Lake (perhaps 3 miles).  We do the long climb out of Garnet Lake, get up and over a ridge and start a very rocky descent with switchbacks down to Shadow Creek where there's a trail junction to Ediza Lake.  At that junction, we see all sorts of people camped as apparently lots of the camp sites past here are marked as closed for restoration.  We see the father/son from Indiana again and they decide they're stopping here to camp.  We aren't particularly interested in camping here with all these other people (though it's forested and there's a good river) so we push on hoping to find something better.</p>

<p>As we descend and follow the creek, we see numerous possible camp sites, but they are all marked as "Closed for Restoration".  This is getting quite annoying.  We're tired, we want to camp and we didn't know we'd have to deal with so many closures.  We cross the creek and Pete's Android app describes a camp site just up the hill from where we are just before reaching Shadow Lake.  We go up to investigate and find a site just big enough for the four of us.  It's not perfect, but as tired as we are, we're not picky either.  It's a bit of a walk down to the river to get water, but we'll take it.  We're already losing our sunlight so we set up camp and eat dinner.  This was a long hot day and we're pretty tired.  The map says we did 14.5 mi. Richard's GPS says 17 miles. There turn out to be a number of mosquitoes here (first camp they've been bad in) so we all go into our tents and zip up to escape them as soon as we're done eating.  I sent my first sat phone text message to Steph tonight telling her where we are.  We have 11 miles more to go tomorrow to get to Red's Meadow the next day - mostly downhill.</p>

<p>As the sun goes down, Corey gets a pretty serious bloody nose (probably from the dryness and altitude) and has trouble getting the bleeding to stop.  He's pinching his nose and stuffing it with gauze.  Apparently he and Pete work on this many times through the night (not a good night for either of them) and he's still dealing with it the next morning.
