<p>I had a great recovery sleep and awoke refreshed.  Very different from the previous morning.  I didn't get such an early start because I spent a lot of time taking care of my feet, but this has become a very important part of the day.  The torn up padding in the heels of my boots is getting worse and now it's abrading the back of my heels.  If I snug up my boots tightly, then it jambs this rough surface into my heels and makes the skin sore (likely leading to a blister).  If I leave the boots a little looser, then the heels can move up and down a bit (also potentially leading to a blister).  Neither is ideal, but protecting my heels and leaving the boots a little looser seems to be the better of the two options.  I'm keeping an eye on the structural part of the heel of the boot because if that falls apart, then I will probably need new boots, but if it's just a comfort issue and managing the heel skin, I can hopefully nurse my feet through to the end of the hike.  But, I've got to make sure my feet don't get any worse and stop and take care of things at the first sign of trouble.  Today, I'm experimenting with a double wide strip of Gorilla tape on each heel and I'm custom trimming each one to round all the corners so hopefully it will stay on.  This whole operation takes 30 minutes or so and then I'm on my way.</p>

<p>The nice thing about the span between Mather Pass and Pinchot Pass is that the trail only drops down to 10,000 feet between them and it's only a short distance between them.  In the overall situation of the hike, if I had to have one day that I would bonk at the end and not get as far as I wanted, then yesterday was actually a good day for that to happen as I still only have about 5 miles to Pinchot Pass and only a 2000' climb.  Wow, I said "only a 2000' climb".  I guess that puts things in perspective here on the southern half of the JMT - you're happy NOT to have a 3500' climb.</p>

<p>Anyway, the trail immediately starts with an 800' switchback climb out of the Kings River valley up to the trail junctions for Taboose Pass and Bench Lake.  I feel fresh this morning so this climb among the forest isn't so bad.  When you get out of the river valley, you come out on a high plain without as many trees and you start the gradual ascent up to Pinchot Pass.</p>

<p>Coming the other way is a gentleman who looks to be in his late 60s and it looks like he's been on the trail for a long time (long silvery beard and weathered face) and I remark that he sure came over Pinchot Pass early this morning.  He explained that he actually came over in the evening and then camped at the base of the pass.  He's doing the PCT, but was hit by some injury (which he didn't explain) and had to be off the trail for four weeks recovering.  Now, he's back to the PCT.  His pace is relatively slow (only making about 10 miles/day) and he's realistic that he might only get to the Oregon border, but he's going to make it as far as he can.  He explains to me what the trail up to Pinchot Pass is like and makes it sound fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>Because of the additional rain we had last night, there are little creeks everywhere and, according to the map, there's a creek going across the trail pretty close to the pass so I don't really have to worry about stocking up on water anytime soon.  I'll just stop and drink when I feel like it rather than carry much water.  Lake Marjorie (11,132') is pretty sizable, but it almost looks like it's set into a moonscape and one whole side of the lake is nothing but broken up pieces of granite in giant slide areas.  The other shore has a few struggling small trees, but this looks like a harsh existence up here.</p>

<p>As I get further up the valley near the headwaters, I play the usual game of trying to figure out where the pass actually is.  Several times I pull out the map and try to figure it out, but the map just isn't a large enough scale to really pinpoint where exactly the trail goes relative to my landmarks and in these granite boulder strewn faces, you can't see traces of a trail.  I come upon what I think is the last creek before the pass so I stop and take a good food and water break.  I'm wary of running low on energy like yesterday so I'm trying to spread out my food more evenly through the day and now is time for a good snack.  While I'm resting here, a young couple goes by on their way up to the pass.  We exchange a few words and off they go.  I'm enjoying my rest, but I have this silly competitive nature that is bugged by the fact that someone passed me.  Nobody passes me on an ascent.  Cut it out John.  You're enjoying the day and it shouldn't matter if they went by.</p>

<p>Eventually, I can see that the trail is just headed towards a rock face.  From my distance, it looks like an incredibly steep face and I wouldn't have imagined that you could put a trail up it.  But, sure enough that's where the trail goes.  The last 700' of climb is very steep and my hat is off to the trail builders for figuring out how to navigate this slope.  It's another one of those slopes where you're better off not looking up and trying to figure out how much further you have.  It will just frustrate you because you see a false summit, then realize you can't really see where you're going.  So, I decide to just keep my head down and make steady forward progress.  This late into the hike, I'm starting to figure out that my best pace is to slow down to a pace that I can just keep going forever at without stopping.  This doesn't mean I never stop, but it seems to work better to keep the pace slow enough that you don't have to stop.   It's also powerful psychologically because you literally feel like you could keep going forever and you don't worry as much about how much more climbing there is to go or where the top is.</p>

<p>Finally Pinchot Pass comes into view and I'm there.  Again, it's a pretty good view in both directions but both directions look so barren and stark.  The clouds are starting to look a bit threatening again so I'm again glad I'm going over in the morning.  I take my usual pictures from the pass in both directions and sit down to have a bit of lunch.  I'm chatting a bit with the couple that passed me on the way up.  They're also doing the JMT, but didn't want to carry as much food as I carried out of MTR so they're going to take two extra days to hike out to the east at Kearsarge Pass and resupply in Independence, then hike back to the JMT and do the last couple days to Whitney.  I'm glad I don't have to do that (fingers crossed that my boots don't fall apart).</p>

<p>When I'm ready to start down that same couple is also getting ready to go and we end up hiking together for the next few hours which really makes the time go by quickly.  They both grew up in Vermont but have just moved to Montana (literally the week before they started the JMT) because he just finished med school and got an internship there.  She is a botanist and is hoping to work for the park service there.  This trip is their one big trip before they plunge into the work world and two week vacation limits and all that.  After hiking surprisingly quickly (they are fast descenders), they decide to take a break for lunch and I keep going.Once again, we're in a new headwaters and this time it's Woods Creek.  The further I hike, the more water it picks up and by now, it's a pretty sizable river.  As has been the pattern, the trail will follow Wood's Creek downhill for a pretty good descent (down to 8492') and then as the river turns west to flow to the central valley, the JMT will turn south and start ascending up Baxter Creek towards the next pass (Glen Pass in this case).  I stop for my own food and water break at a little stream crossing the trail and study the weather up ahead.  It looks like it's raining up ahead exactly where I'm going, but I'm hopeful that maybe the rain will move on before I get there.  Not five minutes later, I start to feel some rain drops.  By now, I know the drill.  Get my rain jacket out of the dry bag and accessible, put any clothes I have out drying into the dry bag so they at least don't get more wet and decide whether I need to cover the pack with the dry bag.  If the threat looks serious, pack up my camera so it can't get wet.  This threat looks serious an hour or two from now, but doesn't seem serious at the moment so I only put the laundry away and get the rain jacket out.  As I start hiking again, the raindrops get bigger and I put the rain jacket on, but it doesn't last long and pretty soon I'm way too hot so I stop again to take off the rain jacket.  There's always this constant tension in these circumstances between being prepared for sudden downpour and not being hot in the rain jacket and not wanting to stop and take the pack off every time you want to take the jacket on/off.  These "breathable" jackets may let some moisture through, but nowhere near enough if you're doing serious hiking.</p>

<p>The terrain coming down from Pinchot Pass is pretty rough.  It descends 3500' in 3.8 miles.  I would not want to be doing Pinchot Pass northbound.  It's interesting how the same elevation pass can be quite a different experience from one side vs. the other.  Muir Pass wasn't too bad from the north, but I would not like it from the south. Same for Pinchot.  Mather Pass on the other hand is nasty from the north and not as bad the other direction.  There are very few trees here but that's probably because there's hardly any soil as the whole area is just littered with rockslides and piles of boulders.  You can see places where the trail has been rerouted because of rock slides too.  As the creek and trail turns more to the west, the descent gets steeper and it starts to really rain.  I put on my rain jacket and put a garbage bag over the pack and just figure I'll keep hiking in the rain, but I'm hoping my boots and socks don't get too wet.  I'm extremely wary of wet and slippery rocks because it's steep here and I don't want to take another fall.  As I descend into a wooded area, there's a northbound hiker huddled under a tree with a Kindle wrapped in a ziplock bag and he's reading an electronic book.  He's headed over Pinchot Pass, but decided he would just take a break until the rain let up.  He doesn't look like he's in a talkative mood so I keep moving.</p>

<p>By now, I can see down the canyon I'm descending to where another canyon joins at right angles and that's where the JMT turns left and starts ascending up Baxter Creek.</p>

<p>And, it's still raining down there too so I may have rain for awhile longer.  Unfortunately, I don't have pictures for a few hours because the camera is all put away in its rain protection.  When crossing a tributary creek on some rocks, my foot slips right into the creek and that boot and sock are completely wet.  Hmm, that wasn't the plan and now I'm wondering if I'll have to stop and change socks.  My toe on that foot has been really bugging me the last couple hours so I'll have to see what happens now that everything is wet on that foot.  After another thirty minutes or so, it dawns on me that the toe on my wet foot no longer hurts and I don't seem to have any other problems on that foot.  Go figure, you spend all this time trying to keep your feet dry and now it feels better when it's all wet.  I may not understand it, but its a good outcome for now.</p>

<p>I finally reach the low elevation of the day (8492') as the JMT turns south and crosses Wood's Creek on a very cool suspension bridge.  I'm thinking to myself that I'd love to have some pictures of this bridge and maybe even some video as I walk across it, but it's still raining steadily so I leave the camera in its two layers of rain protection.  I haven't stopped in a long while because of the rain and I could probably use some water, but this doesn't look like a great place to stop so I'll go up Baxter Creek a bit and find a place to stop up there.</p>

<p>As I've experienced before, the body goes through an odd transition when you switch from a couple hours of steep descent to suddenly climbing again and, as before, it takes 15-20 minutes before you start to feel comfortable climbing again.  At this point, I'm thinking that the goal is get at least to Dollar Lake to get a decent start on Glen Pass for tomorrow and I'll see based on the weather and how I feel whether I want to go any further.  At long last, the rain stops and the sun even comes out briefly. Suddenly it feels really humid in the sunshine and I start to get really hot.  I come across a tributary creek (that's actually a bit of a challenge to cross) and I stop for some food and water and a much needed rest for my legs.  While I'm stopped another solo hiker comes up to the creek.  I explain to him where I was able to find a good way across, but he doesn't even acknowledge that I'm there.  He finds his own way across and goes on without saying a word to me.  This is very odd behavior on the trail because people are literally always friendly.  He's a guy who looks to me in his late 20s and it looks like he has a really, really heavy pack with various gadgets and accessories hanging off it all over (I don't like things swinging off my pack if I can avoid it).  Maybe his heavy pack has made him grumpy.  Anyway, we see each other several more times as I pass him when he's resting and he passes me when I'm resting and he never once says a single word.  Definitely an odd character.</p>

<p>The climb to Dollar Lake seems to take a long time.  I'm actually feeling pretty strong, but just want to get there.  The trail is climbing fairly steeply so I'm regularly scanning up front looking for signs of a moraine that once you climb over it might hold the lake behind it.  It's just too hard to figure out where it really is.  Eventually, I arrive at Dollar Lake.  It looks crowded.  The best campsites on the lake appear to all be "closed for restoration" and that's forced everyone else into a relatively small area.  This looks a bit too crowded for me.  The weather doesn't look imminently threatening so I decide to go on to Rae Lakes.  Depending upon which lake I stop at, it's somewhere around 1.5 to 2 miles and only about 300' more of climbing which should take me about an hour.  I am getting pretty tired now (this will clearly be my 2nd longest day), but I still have enough energy to push forward.  I've heard Rae Lakes is pretty and I will be pretty close to Glen Pass the next day.</p>

<p>Fin Dome is a very prominent landmark and, as soon as I get past Dollar Lake, it's easy to see (a big rounded spire of rock that stands up above the other things around it).  That gives me a pretty good idea where I'm going as the first of the Rae Lakes is right below it.  That gives me a pretty good idea where I'm going as the first of the Rae Lakes is right below it.</p>

<p>It's heavy overcast now and certainly could rain again at any time, but there's no thunder and I don't see any obvious rain yet.  The trail goes by Arrowhead Lake which is marshy and not appropriate for camping, then up a bit and I get to the first of the three Rae lakes.  I see lots of people camped and there are bear boxes in some locations.  I start looking for a place to camp that isn't too close to other campers.  As it's late in the day, I'm not expecting to be anywhere near a bear box so that isn't really even a consideration.  The trail skirts away from the lake so I leave the trail and decide I'll walk along the short of the lake and see if I can find a place to camp that way.  Eventually I find a good place and it's about 6pm.  My spot is not right on the water like I'd like (the lake is over a small rise), but it's only 50 yards or so away from the water.  I can see one other group of campers, but they aren't that close and I'm on a nice sandy area that should be good for the tent with some big flat rocks to use for sitting and setting stuff on.  I get the tent set up quickly and, with the clouds looking the way they do, I set the tent up very carefully for rain (which means setting it low and wide).  I hang a few items of laundry up, go fetch some water and make myself dinner.  When I finally get a break from all the activity, I realize how tired I am.  Adding it all up, this was an 18 mile day - another epic day.  But, I'm close to Glen Pass for tomorrow and the Rae Lakes area is amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>After dinner, the sunset treats to me some fantastic colors.  I walk over to where I have a better view of the lake and mountains and take a bunch of pictures of the colors of the sunset over the lakes and mountains.  I also take several panoramas that I'll stitch together when I get home.  Right in the middle of the sunset, my camera battery goes out and I have to high-tail it back to camp, grab a new battery and get back to my shooting position.  As sometimes happens with sunsets, the colors just keep getting better.  At last the color fades, almost on queue it starts to rain.  I quickly secure things for a rainy night (get the laundry down, put the bear container away and crawl in the tent.  As I'm laying down in the tent, I'm feeling immense pain in my lower back.  I have no idea what I did, but it's really painful.  I can't find any position lying down that relieves the pain.  It's the kind of back pain that takes your breath away and makes it hard to breath.  I'm OK sitting or standing, but can't seem to lay down.  I have no idea what caused this.  I'm hoping its just my core reacting to a very long day and that it will be better in the morning, but now I'm not so sure.  It could also be that doing something around camp causes me to pull a muscle in my back so maybe it's not just fatigue. It runs through my head that I've probably got an extra day of food with me so if need be, I could just stay here tomorrow and let it rest.  While it's still raining pretty good, I get up and go to the bear container to grab some Advil and I take a good dose of Advil hoping that gives me enough relief to get to sleep.  I try every position possible on the sleeping pad and eventually find some sort of position where I'm half on and half off the pad that gives me enough relief that I can at least breathe and fall asleep.</p>
