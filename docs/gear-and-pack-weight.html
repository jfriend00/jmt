<p>I turn my attention to the rest of the gear.  The web contains numerous pack lists (often in spreadsheet format) for the JMT and I find a combination of 3-4 of these pack lists to be a very useful resource.  The existing lists give you a list of items to go down to see if you have everything you think you need and they often list specific brands of items with their specific weight.  I already have a lot of backpacking gear so I buy an accurate digital postal scale (can weigh things that are a fraction of an ounce up to several pounds) and I start my own pack list spreadsheet with the weight of the actual items I already own or the weight when I acquire them.  This takes quite awhile to fill out the actual weight of everything you think you need to bring.  The ultra-lightweight research I've been doing discusses that it as important to understand what you do NOT need to bring as it is to select the right ultralight item to bring.  And, one key tenet of ultralight packing is knowing what you don't really need and exactly how much of something you do need.</p>

<p>Here are other items I brought:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hydration bladder</li>
    <li>Plastic water bottle</li>
    <li>Wide 1 liter mouth bottle for Steripen purifying</li>

    <li>Toothbrush and Toothpaste</li>
    <li>Spare ziplocks</li>
    <li>2 Garbage bags (one to cover backpack in rain, the other for kilt)</li>
    <li>Money, credit card, license, permit</li>
    <li>Backpacking towel (incredibly useful)</li>
    <li>Journal/pencil</li>
    <li>Cat hole trowel</li>
    <li>Matches</li>
    <li>First Aid</li>

<h2>Pack Weight</h2>

<p>OK, with all these items, my carried pack weight without water or fuel adds up to 18 lbs in principle in the spreadsheet.  Pack everything in the pack the way you're actually going to carry it all and it ends up being 20lbs on the scale (must have been some things missing in the spreadsheet).  If you add in 1 liter of water (2lbs) and 10 days of  food at 1.5lbs / day, and fuel (1lb) then you're at 38 lbs coming out of MTR.  That should be the worst case.</p>

<p>I know from my practice hikes that there's a big difference in the effect on my body between carrying 35 lbs and carrying 40 lbs.  If I could get this down to 35 lbs, it sure would be nice.  I go through the whole list of items again to see if there's anything I could change/reduce.  The only items that I see are the sleeping bag, the pack itself and my camera equipment.  It seems like it's too late to switch out the pack (I've been training with this one for a long time by now).  I'm committed to the newly acquired camera equipment.  I don't really want to spend the money on a new sleeping bag or go with one rated at a significantly higher temperature.  There's some debate about how much sunscreen, toilet paper and insect repellent one needs for each segment, but we're talking an ounce of two difference so this isn't going to tip the scales in a big way.  So, it looks like I'm going to deal with 38 lbs coming out of MTR.  Fortunately, it should only be 26 lbs coming out of Tuolumne and 30.5 coming out of Red's Meadow and obviously the pack weight drops as you consume the food.  I've been doing my practice hikes with 35 lbs so I know I can handle that.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I should have gotten a lighter sleeping bag.  Not only would I have saved some weight, but the bag I had was too warm most nights.  While I did use its full warmth a couple cold nights, there were many nights where it was hard to get comfortable because the bag was just too warm.  On the cold nights, I would have either just slept cooler or had to wear a little more clothing.
