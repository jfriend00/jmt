<h2>Day 17 - Wright Creek to Guitar Lake</h2>
<img class="photo" src="images/day-17-map.png">
<p>8mi, climb 1000' - camp at 11,700'
It was a cold and clear night and I didn't want to get out of the sleeping bag in the morning and didn't have to.  I took my time in the morning, soaked up some sun, gave the laundry a little more of a chance to dry and got going about 10.  I only have about 8 miles to go today.  After crossing Wright Creek and hiking about another mile, we get to Wallace Creek and it's flowing pretty heavy (likely lots of rain up in its headwaters just north of Whitney the day before).  The usual stepping stones are under water.  I explore both upstream and downstream looking for an alternate crossing, but can't find one.  OK, I guess I'll have to take off my boots and wade across in my sandals.  I was hoping not to get the bandages wet on my feet, but it doesn't look avoidable and I need to keep the boots and socks dry.  That whole process takes awhile, but eventually I'm underway on the other side of the creek.  There's a pretty good ascent up and out of the valley where Wallace Creek is and the trail then needs to get around to the south of Mt Young and Mt Hale (two 13,000+ mountains near Whitney).  Time just seems to go slowly on this segment of the hike.  There aren't any particularly scenic milestones and I really just want to get to Guitar Lake and relax before tomorrow.  It seems like I've been going longer than I would have expected  and should have already hit the turn where the trail leaves the PCT and heads up towards Guitar Lake.  I'm so convinced that maybe I've missed that turn that I pull out the sat phone GPS and check my position.  According to the GPS coordinates, I'm only a short distance away from the turnoff, but I haven't hit it yet.  Sure enough, it's only about 200 yards away.  Now I'm leaving the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and heading up the last part of the JMT.  Guitar Lake is about at 11,500' so I've got another 800' of climbing to do to get there.  Unfortunately, I'm not in the climbing mood today.  In my head, this was supposed to be an easy day and climbing from 10,700' to 11,500' doesn't fit into my mold of an "easy" day.  Oh well, I've got all afternoon (it's only noon) so I can take it at whatever speed I want.
At a location near the Crabtree ranger station, there's a wag bag container where folks going up Whitney and down to Whitney Portal need to pick up there wag bag to be used when past Guitar Lake.  For those of you who don't know what a wag bag, it's a special bag for your human waste.  Basically, you have to poop and pee into the bag (the bag contains chemicals that "deactivate" the waste somewhat) and carry it out with you.  The challenge in the Whitney Zone is that more than 20,000 people a year use that trail and the terrain just can't handle the human waste from that many people.  There's very little actual dirt to bury waste and even if you could, the climate won't really decompose it very quickly.  So, if you're finishing at Whitney Portal where they have facilities for disposing of this, you have to take a wag bag and use it for all human waste.</p>

<p>I keep hoping for a glimpse of Whitney from the east, but the combination of other mountains and close by trees just never give me a good look.  I take an extended lunch break at a nice creek in a meadow and then arrive at Guitar Lake by 2pm.  There are already a number of people camped here so I wander around to the far side of the lake and find a pretty cool campsite.  It's not real close to the water, but it's a perfectly flat spot for the tent with a nice view.  The gravel I put the tent on won't take tent stakes as it's only about 3" deep so I have to use rocks for many of the stakes.  It's also occasionally pretty windy (big gusts) and there is just zero protection from the wind so I want to make sure the tent can withstand whatever wind there might be tonight.</p>

<p>The sun is out and I spend most of the afternoon laying in the sun just relaxing and soaking up some rays.  I did a full food inventory and got rid of some soggy triscuits that I'd been hauling around and dried out the inside of the bear container (some rain got in the bear container).  I was thinking about giving myself a double dinner tonight since I have extra, but I decided that I didn't want to take any chances at upsetting my intestinal cycle which could be pretty inconvenient in the Whitney zone with the wag bag.  So, I stick to what I've done every other day and figure I can have a few extra snacks tomorrow morning if I need more energy.  I laid out tomorrow's food for a no cook breakfast and set the alarm on my watch for 5am as I hope to be on the trail by 6.  If it goes according to plan, I should be down to Whitney Portal by 4 and Steph will pick me up by 5.  I have 3 liters of water since there's no water until Trail Camp (the longest stretch of the trip without water).  This might be more than I need (it is), but I can dump some at some point if need be.  By getting an early start, I should be doing most of my climbing while it's cool (that turns out to be an understatement).  I wasn't psyched for today's hike, but I am psyched for tomorrow.  I just need to remember the very slow, sustainable pace on the 3000' ascent up to Trail Junction at 13,484'.  I hope to be on top of Whitney by 11.
To my surprise, Diane and the father/son came by late in the day (they must have camped at Tyndall Creek so they had further to go today) and they're going up higher (up around 12,000') where there is reportedly a water source and they can get a head start on tomorrow.  The father/son plan to leave camp around 1am and try to make it up to the top of Whitney for sunrise (brrr).  I'll be happy to be there in the daytime.</p>

<p>I patched up my toe tonight with a new idea.  This time I wrapped two layers of moleskin around the toe and then taped around that.  The idea is that if I make it big enough, it will be raised up and bigger than its neighbor and can't be swept underneath the neighbor and squished.  It seems like a promising idea.  Hopefully it will work?
The sun disappeared behind a hill and it's already getting colder.  I will probably be asleep by 8.
