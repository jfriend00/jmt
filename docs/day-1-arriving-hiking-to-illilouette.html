<h2>Day 1 - Arriving and then Hiking to Illilouette</h2>
<img class="photo" src="images/day-1-map.png">
<p>5.4 mi, 1000' down, 600' up, camp at 6640'</p>

<p>The first day was a complicated day logistically.  We had to drive to Yosemite, pick up our wilderness permit, drop Richard's car in the backpacker's parking lot at the far end of the park, grab our packs and catch a shuttle bus to Yosemite Lodge, catch the 1:30 Glacier Point tour bus up to Glacier Point and then we could start our hike.  And, all this is on a Saturday where I have visions of huge crowds of people in Yosemite.   Further, there's a notice about road maintenance on both roads into Yosemite that we could take.  When we plan out when to leave home to make absolutely sure we don't miss the 1:30 Glacier Point tour bus, it's one of those situations where you need to decide how much of a worst case scenario you should plan for?  What if we're a little late leaving in the morning (someone isn't ready on time), the road construction holds us up, there's a long line at the entrance station, there's a line to pick up our permit, it takes forever to drive to the far end of the valley, the shuttles are full and our timing doesn't work perfectly and so on...  When we add up all the worst cases, it says we should be hitting the road at 6:30am (all this to eventually get to Glacier Point at 3pm).</p>

<p>Well, we leave at 6:30am and none of the worst case things goes wrong.  There's no construction traffic, nobody at the entrance station or permit office and it's quick to get through Yosemite valley.  Wow, we've got 3 hours to kill.  Oh well, at least it's a nice place to kill some time.  We decide that we can wander around the backcountry store in Curry Village and then hike up to to the Vernal Falls bridge (without our packs).  We then load up our packs and catch the shuttle and get to Yosemite Lodge more than an hour before the Glacier Point bus leaves.  We eat lunch and generally relax and take the bus up to Glacier Point.</p>

<p>At Glacier Point, we wander out to see the view down into the valley and the various viewpoints of Half Dome.  We pose for some pictures, including a picture of the four of us at the trail-head with Half Dome behind and then we're off at 3:40.  The goal is about 4 miles, just into the Illilouette Valley like our permit states and camp for the night.  The Panorama trail immediately starts downhill towards Illilouette Falls.  On our way, we see a ranger hiking out the other way.  I'm fully expecting him to ask to see our permit (such an obvious place to check it), but he just asks us if we all have bear containers and we respond that we do.  As it turns out, that was the one and only ranger we saw the entire JMT.</p>

<p>At the falls, we get our first water on the trail and relax a bit.  It's then uphill to Panorama Point and a junction with the Mono Meadow Trail.  There are great views of Nevada Falls as we are tested by our first uphill stretch at altitude.  I'm huffing and puffing a bit on the uphill and I wouldn't say the pack feels very light, but all-in-all, it's not too bad.  We could hear, but not see Vernal Falls down below us as it's obscured by both cliffs and trees.  There is a perfect place to camp along the Panorama Trail that would simply have an amazing view, but we aren't supposed to camp there so we head down the Mono Meadow trail away from the JMT and the Panorama Trail.  Our intention is to go at least a mile (to comply with the rules about where you can camp).  We start heading up and towards a saddle and we see some more campsites, but we aren't yet far enough from the Panorama Trail so we keep going over the saddle and start downhill on the Mono Meadow Trail.</p>

<p>It is awhile on the descent before it's flat enough to start looking for a camp site.  There are some level areas, but this looks like a really healthy forest with so much fallen debris from the forest that it's hard to find places to put tents.  After about 30 minutes of searching we find a place that we think has enough cleared areas for four tents and by 7:00, we're setting up our tents (except Pete who decides to sleep under the stars) and cooking dinner.  I have my red beans &amp; rice with chocolate squares for dessert.  Tastes pretty darn good.  During dinner, some deer come within 10' of us as they seem interested in a certain type of bush near our campsite.  It's as if we're in their dining room, but they don't seem bothered by us at all.</p>

<p>We go to bed about 9:00 as it starts to get dark.  A short while later I'm startled awake by something breaking branches near us.  I try shining my headlamp on it, but I couldn't see anything.  That first night in the wilderness, the mind goes nuts thinking about the possibility that it's a bear messing with our bear containers.  I manage to convince myself that the odds of that are really low.  This isn't a regular camp site so we wouldn't be on the regular route of a bear and I try to convince myself this is just a deer wandering around trying to get access to that bush they like to eat.
I awake several hours later with a flat air mattress.  Great, first night in the wilderness and my mattress already has a leak!  I blow up the mattress and it doesn't immediately go flat (I  figure out over the course of the night that it takes about 3 hours to go flat) so I go back to sleep.  I wake up again a few hours later and the mattress is flat again.  This time I want to know what time it is so I look all over the tent for my watch only to eventually find it on my wrist!  It was 2am.  I blow up the mattress again and drift off back to sleep until 5:30am.
