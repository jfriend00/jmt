<p>We got pretty close to Selden Pass the day before so its only a short climb up another 800' to get to the pass.  We go by Marie Lake on the way up and get some really nice views from above it looking back.  At the top, there are pretty spectacular views looking both ways and we take our last group shot of the four of us on a pass.</p>

<p>We descend past Heart Lake (which really does look like a heart) and chat for awhile with an elderly gentleman going (very slowly) the other way.  He's working on the JMT himself at about half our pace.  One thing that regularly surprises me is the range of people we see on the JMT.  There are some very out of shape people (e.g. fat hanging over their hip belt), many elderly gentlemen, lots of people in our age range and obviously super fit college age kids and everything in between.  There is no typical profile.  It appears that, with the right training, planning and preparation, a wide variety of people can do the JMT or at least do part of it (I don't know how many of these people actually finish the whole thing in one shot).   Obviously, the body has to be able to stand up to the somewhat relentless day-after-day effort, you have to take good care of your feet and mostly you have to either have tremendous drive to keep going day after day or you have to just really enjoy being out there and the adventure of it all.</p>

<p>For me, I'd say it was a combination of things.  I loved being out there.  The scenery is simply unparalleled and I loved both seeing it and capturing it with my camera.  But, I also just love the challenge of it all.  I trained as much as I've ever trained for anything (probably more diligently than I trained for my first marathon).  I spent a lot of time preparing, researching and making sure I had everything I needed for the trip.  I just wanted to complete the whole thing.  It's like someone threw down the gauntlet and said, "Can you do this?".  I responded with "Just watch me".  I was thrown a few curve balls along the way and you'll read about them in the coming days, but they were just extra challenges.  I never got to the point where I wondered if I could make it.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the descent into MTR.  We stopped for a break above Heart Lake and then went by the Sallie Keyes Lakes and did a little research on where else we could get water.  We knew that we have a long and potentially dry descent into MTR so we have to make sure we got tanked up with water at a good spot before we hit the dry stretch.  The info we had said that we should find one or two good creeks after Sallie Keyes Lakes so we didn't stop yet and pressed on.  The trail past Sallie Keyes starts to descend a bit, but mostly goes along the side of a very deep canyon and we can see down below generally where MTR is (though as is usual from far away, we don't know exactly where to look for it).</p>

        The trail down to Muir Trail Ranch starts to steepen
    </figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Our info about water was right and we filled up at Senger Creek and then the major descent started.  It was mostly overcast (storms the night before) so we were probably saved from some significant heat because it was really dry on this descent.  Very long switchbacks (like 1/4 to 1/2 mile long for each segment) down a rocky, bouldery, dusty and steep descent.  Can you tell that this wasn't my most favorite part of the trail?  I supposed it's partly the anticipation of getting to our resupply at MTR and partly just because the long descent isn't particularly interesting, but it seems to take forever.  It's one of those segments of the trail where you can essentially see your destination from a long ways away.  It looks like you should be there in an hour, but after an hour you aren't even half way there. And, because you're just going down a big, long slope you don't get to see anything new as you descend either.  You just slowly get closer and closer to the bottom of the canyon.</p>

<p>Finally, we reach the cut-off trail to Muir Trail Ranch (MTR) and we temporarily leave the JMT on a detour to MTR.  Almost immediately, you can see a difference in how the trail is built and maintained.  The cut-off trail is steeper and a lot rockier and it reminds you how much work they put into building and maintaining the JMT.  We meet some folks going up that are taking a long break and they look beat already.  I'm thinking to myself that they look beat and they aren't even 1/8 of the way up and it's already early afternoon.  Hopefully they know what they're doing.</p>

<p>At last we get down the steep part of the cut-off trail and hit another junction that takes us the last bit to MTR.  Another half mile and we see the gate into MTR.  OK, we're here.  For practical purposes, this is the half way point on the JMT and, for me, it's going to be a goodbye to my trailmates and I'm going to go the second half solo.</p>

<p>I dig around in my ziplock wallet and find our resupply receipt and then out they come with three buckets.  Since Pete and Corey are leaving, their main job is to figure out what from the resupply buckets they want to haul home and what they can donate here to other hikers.  For me, I've got to pack up my bear container with food for the 2nd half of the trip.</p>

        Tables for sorting, organizing and repacking your resupply
    </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>I clean out my bear container (trash and leftover food) and then start laying out my new food supplies on a big table.  For reasons I can't quite figure out now, I get thoroughly confused on how to approach getting my food organized.  I lay it out one way, then reorganize it again, then don't like they direction that's going, then think of another approach.  The whole thing is very inefficient.  I think my problem is that I've decided I'm going to take a day's less food with me (figuring I can shave a day off the 2nd half of the trip like we did with the first half), but I can't seem to figure out how to do that.  It still baffles me why I got so confused.  My only explanation now is that I just had a lot of complicated emotions running around in my head as I was about to head off solo hiking in the hardest terrain I've ever seen with a very heavy pack and I've never, ever done this before.  And, with all those emotions running around in my head, I didn't just sit down, clear my mind for a second and make a plan for organizing and packing the food.</p>

<p>Finally, I realized I was getting nowhere with my organizing and I came up with a much easier approach.  I knew there was 10 days of food in the resupply.  I knew I wanted to eliminate one day's worth of food.  So rather than starting from scratch to re-organize 9 days of food, just pick one day's worth of food and remove it.  Then, pack the rest.  So simple. I could have been done an hour ago.  I even added one more optimization.  Set aside the first two days of food and put them on top of the bear container so I could get at them without unpacking everything.  OK, finally had a plan.  I can do this.  I remove a day's worth of food and I sort things this way and then start loading the bear container.  I get to the last couple days and it almost fits, but not quite.  This was always one of the worries.  OK, tonight's food doesn't have to be in the bear container (it will get consumed before going to sleep) so I can put that in the pack, not the bear container.  Hmmm, still doesn't fit.  The culprit is the triscuit crackers I brought for lunches to go with peanut butter and with hummus.  They just take up too much volume.</p>

<p>OK, let's start over.  Take everything out.  Reseal every individual ziplock bag trying to get some more air out.  As you pack things into the bottom of the bear container, really crunch things in.  If the crackers get smushed into small pieces, so be it.  They're still the same number of calories.  Ok, this time everything fits.  I have one dinner and a few snacks in my pack to consume before going to sleep.</p>

<p>Now, I go through the rest of my consumables (sunscreen, toilet paper, insect repellant, band-aids, etc...) to see what I really don't need.  I get rid of some things that I'm unlikely to use and pair the quantities down to just what I think I'll need for 9 days based on my consumption the first 9 days.  Now, I pick up some things from Pete and Corey (stove, fuel, satellite phone).  We calculate that one fuel canister should be more than enough for me.  That's it - I have everything and I can't remove anything else - it all has to go into the pack now.  I start packing.  In the first half of the trip, I had developed quite a system.  Everything had it's exact place in the pack.  Now, that was being challenged a bit because I had a bunch of new things that needed to find their place.  I finally get everything into the pack and I'm running through a mental checklist with Pete.  He asks if I have the cooking pot.  Nope, I don't.  Hmmm, that would have been interesting if I didn't have a pot.  OK, now I've got the pot (not sure where to put it in the pack, but I squeeze it into an outer pocket).  Now, I've got everything.</p>

<p>They've got a scale that you can hang your pack on and I'm debating whether I even want to know because there's literally nothing I can do if it's heavier than planned.  Oh well, let's see - 38lbs.  I guess I was hoping for 35lbs and there's a little uncertainty about how accurate the scale is, but since I'm going solo I also have to carry a little more than when we were all together so 38 lbs seems likely based on my base weight, the extra things I'm carrying and the amount of food.  That's a heavy pack.  But, I tell myself that I trained with a pack in the 35-40lb range for just this reason.  I should be able to handle it.</p>

<p>The plan all along was to head over to some hot springs and soak for awhile after doing the resupply, but as it took me a lot longer to get packed than it should have, I'm starting to realize that I might not have time for the hot springs.  It's 22 miles and 4200' of climb from where I am to Muir Pass and I'm carrying a heavy pack.  We've had storm activity the last few evenings so I want to get over Muir Pass before mid-day two days from now.  I can't get over the 2nd morning if it's 22 miles away so it's the 3rd day I'm shooting for.  I need to put some miles in tonight before camping.  Looking at the map, I'd like to do 4-6 miles before dark.  Then, if I put in a 12 mile day the following day, I should be able to get over Muir Pass the morning after that.  So, I tell the guys that I think I've got to leave now and start hiking so I'll skip the hot springs.  We all hike a quarter mile up to a junction where we split off in different directions.  I get totally confused about which way to go which doesn't seem like a good sign as I head off on my own, but once I get squared away as to where I'm going I'm OK.  Pete takes a picture as I head off solo and now I'm off by myself.</p>

<p>There are several pieces to the evening's route. The first is to get back to the JMT on the other part of the MTR cut-off which is about 1.5 miles.   This connects back up with the San Joaquin River and I fill up with water.  Then, there's 1.8 miles to Piute Creek and the bridge across that creek.  After crossing the creek, I see lots of other JMTers camped at that junction.  As it's only about 5pm, I'm still thinking to myself that I can hike a couple more hours and make some good progress.  Just about as I'm passing these other campers, I start to feel some raindrops.  I'm thinking to myself that it's probably going to be like last night and we'll get a few raindrops here and there, but it shouldn't really bother me for another few miles of hiking.</p>

<p>Beyond the Piute Creek junction, the canyon gets steep and the trail is carved out of the side of the canyon some 50-100 feet above the river.  You could climb down to the river in spots to get water if need be, but there are no opportunities to camp here as it's just too steep and rocky.  I've got my sights set on either an area called Aspen Meadow or perhaps up a little further at Franklin Meadow after the trail crosses the river.  Those small raindrops turn into more serious rain.  OK, I stop and get my rain jacket out of the dry bag and put it on.  I can't really stop here so I keep hiking. </p>

    <figcaption>
        This is the  terrain I was in when it started to rain buckets - no place at all to camp.  Have to just keep going
    </figcaption>
</figure>



<p> Now, it's really raining hard.  My pack is getting soaking wet (which isn't making it feel any lighter) and I'm starting to hear serious thunder.  I'm not worried about lightning strikes because I'm in the depths of a big, steep valley and I figure all the lightning action is going on way above me, but I'm starting to get pretty wet.  This is way more rain than we've seen and I'm not really prepared to hike in this level of rain.  Where in the heck can I camp?  Aspen and Franklin Meadows are still a ways out in front of me and it's raining heavily, but there's no place to camp here.  All I can do is quicken the pace and keep going until I find some place to camp.  It crosses my mind to go back to Piute Creek and try to find a spot there, but by the time I start thinking about that, I'm as far from that as I am from the destinations in front of me.  So, I keep going.</p>

<p>All the while I'm thinking to myself that this isn't exactly a great start to my solo hiking experience!  Am I blowing this?  I guess I should have set up camp at Piute Creek at the first sign of bad weather.  But, how was I to know that tonight's rain would be so much more vigorous than previous nights?  You just can't know that.
Anyway, just as I'm about to resign myself to getting seriously soaked on my way to Aspen Meadow, I see a big tree and a smallish flat spot where I could put a tent.  I quick inspection shows that I can also get down to the river here to get water.  I run under the tree to get a respite from the rain and set up my tent faster than I've probably ever done so before.  It's a bit of a race because I don't want the inside of the tent or the top side of the ground cloth to get wet when I'm setting it up because there's no way to dry anything now.  The tent gets set up.  The ground is really soft and a bit muddy and several tent stakes don't hold so I've got to find rocks to help stabilize them.  It looks like it might be windy in addition to the rain and I really don't want tent stakes pulling out in the middle of the night.  By now, I am wet and muddy.  My core is technically still not quite soaked (somewhat protected by my rain jacket), but everything else including my boots and socks is completely wet.  I'm not really thinking about the consequences of all this on tomorrow because I'm completely focused on getting the tent set up, getting a dry sleeping bag into the tent and getting out of the rain.</p>

<p>At long last, I grab a few energy bars (no time to cook dinner), put the bear container 20' away in the rain, put a garbage bag over my pack for the night under the tree and I climb into the tent.  OK, at least I'm out of the rain finally!  The whole last couple hours has been such a whirlwind of activity and decision making that I'm just sort of sitting there in the tent relishing the first moment of rest in awhile.  I'm looking around and thinking about blowing up my sleeping pad to get the bed set up when I realize that there are issues with the way the tent is set up.  The rain has been going long and hard enough that it's starting to form channels of run-off and some of those channels are heading towards my tent.  Further, the tent doesn't quite seem set up right and there's some rain getting in and onto the top of the ground cloth.  None of those things are good.  On top of all that, I'm basically out of water so I need to go down to the river and purify some water.  Ok, back out in the rain again to work on those issues.  I lower the hiking pole that serves as the central pole for the tarp tent and then readjust all the lines.  Good, that looks like it might keep the rain out better as the tarp now extends out further beyond the edges of the internal floor/ground cloth (but isn't as tall inside).  I create some diversion channels to help funnel the rain water coming down the slope around my tent instead of right under it.  I hike down to the river and get some water.  I can see that the rain is already having an effect on the river as it's visibly swollen now and running must faster.</p>

<p>OK, back in the tent.  This time I think I'm going to stay in here.  By now, it's getting pretty dark as much from the storm as from the sun going down and I start to realize that I'm cold.  I need to get out of these wet clothes and into a dry sleeping bag.  Well, that's not that easy to do in the now lowered tarp tent, but eventually I manage to get the sleeping pad blown up, the sleeping bag unstuffed and on top of it, out of all my wet clothes and into my lightweight silk thermals.  I try to figure out where I should best position the sleeping pad and sleeping bag to keep it out of the rain, keep it away from any tent condensation and keep it from pressing down on the curled up sides of the ground cloth that are keeping the flowing water off the ground cloth.  I finally climb into the sleeping bag, stuff my jacket into my pillowcase (that's my makeshift pillow) and I just lay there and listen to the rain.  I'm physically drained, but at least I'm finally starting to feel drier and warmer.</p>

<p>Then, it occurs to me that I haven't had anything for dinner.  In the fury of getting out of the rain, I just grabbed some energy bars that were intended as "extra food" for the next couple days.  I find those in the tent (they can't stay in the tent with me anyway because of bears),  find my water bottle and I eat two energy bars.  This is just going to have to do for tonight.  I'm not going out in the rain again to cook anything.  Plus the bear container and pack are all put away anyway to get access to any more food.  I drift off to sleep.</p>
