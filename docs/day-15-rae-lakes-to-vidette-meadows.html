<p>I don't remember anything from the night so I think the very long day must have just knocked me out.  By early morning, my back is still sore, but not even close to as bad it was the night before.  But, it's still raining pretty heavily.  Since I'm pretty close to Glen Pass, I don't feel the need to get moving while it's still raining and I don't really want to go over the pass in a rain storm anyway.  There isn't any thunder so at least it's just rain.  I call Steph on the sat phone and she says the forecast is that the chances of rain should lessen by the afternoon.  I doze on and off for much of the morning and finally at about 10:30 am, it stops raining.</p>

<p>I emerge from the tent to discover that I had a great place for a tent in the rain (maybe all these previous nights of rain taught me something).  The sandy, decomposed granite handled the rain really well and there was no runoff coming towards my tent.  Despite all the rain, everything except the tent is dry.  The clouds are clinging to the mountains rimming the Rae Lakes, but the air seems crystal clear.</p>

<p>My back is a little sore, but nothing like the night before and it doesn't seem like it will really bother me much today though I take some Advil for it.  I get myself fed and pack up the wet tent and all my other gear and hit the trail a little after 11am.  The group camping near me is about 15 minutes ahead of me as they started packing up while it was still raining.</p>

<p>The trail goes by the other two Rae Lakes giving me some gorgeous photos and then it starts going up Glen Pass.</p>

<p>It's fairly clear right away that this is going to be another low energy day.  The trail up to Glen Pass feels like a trudge rather than a hike.  I'm thinking to myself that I just need to get over Glen Pass and down the other side and I don't have to get up close to the base of Forester because I don't have to go far after Forester Pass if I don't feel like it.  So, if I need a short day, I could take one today.  As the trail leaves Rae Lakes and starts ascending up to Glen Pass, it's only two miles, but it's 1400' of up so that's pretty steep.  After 15 minutes of climbing, I stop and take a break at a creek.  I'm very conscious of eating in case the reason I'm feeling low on energy is that I got behind in my calories yesterday with the 18 mile day.  I feel a little better after the break and just try to find that zone where you climb slowly, but feel like you could keep going all day.  I don't think I have that zone this day - the climb is just hard at any pace.  If you just keep going forward and take a rest when you need it, eventually you'll get there and that's pretty much how I'd describe this one.</p>

<p>Progressing slowly, I make it to Glenn Pass by 12:30.  The view back down to Rae Lakes is gorgeous and there's a completely different landscape over the other side.</p>

<p>It's amazing how some of these passes work that way where the terrain is so different on one side vs. the other.  The sun pops out briefly while I'm at the top helping me to get some good pictures and then I start down the other side.  I'm headed to several trail junctions, the first to Kearsarge Pass which is one of the closest approaches to the southern half of the JMT from the east and then trails to Charlotte Lake and Bullfrog Lake and then the trail west to Road's End which is part of the Rae Lakes loop route.  My goal today is to at least get down to the low point (9515') at the Road's End trail junction where the trail picks up Bubb's Creek and camp at Vidette Meadow, but if I feel good, I may go further up Bubb's Creek as the trail plays touch and go with the creek for many miles and the map shows forest so that usually means you can camp.  Since I had such a long day yesterday and I don't have to go far after Forester Pass the next day, I can play things by ear, but I don't need to push things.  I would like a swim and a chance to do some laundry so maybe an earlier camp would make sense.</p>

<p>The descent from Glen Pass is quite scenic.  I'm still not feeling particularly energetic, but it isn't as bad as it was after Mather Pass so I'm doing OK.  I meet up with Diane again and I'm quite surprised to see her.  I thought with my very long days that perhaps I was a day ahead.  But she gets up super early in the morning and starts hiking early even if it's raining and that's how she got over Glen Pass ahead of me.  While I was waiting out the rain, she was hiking in it.  We hike together for awhile along with another guy that I had seen at the top of Glen Pass.  Eventually, Diane decides to stop for a break and we keep going.  We descend steeply into the Charlotte Lake area and then finally down to Bubb's Creek.  Diane catches me as I'm on a break and we hike on together a little further.  She decides that she's going to camp here at Vidette Meadows (there are bear boxes here) and I decide I'm going to hike another hour or so and then set up camp.  I find a spot on the river and just as I get my tent set up, it starts raining.  I'm lying in my tent and quite exhausted from the day and hoping the rain stops so I can come out and cook dinner.  Finally it does and I feel much better after dinner.  It's starting to get dark now, it's not very warm and the sun is long since gone, but I start thinking about that bath I wanted to get today.  OK, let's do it.  I strip down to my underwear and climb in the river - brrrr.  I'm able to quickly rinse my hair and give myself a quick dunk before scrambling out, drying off, putting on my silk thermals and putting on my jacket.  OK, love getting clean, but brrr that was cold.  I secure things for the night and crawl back in the tent as it starts to rain again.  I washed my hiking shirt and hung it out.  Oh well, I may have to put it on wet in the morning.</p>

<p>Forester Pass (13,200') looms for tomorrow as the highest pass other than Whitney on the JMT.  Psychologically I'm a bit worried about it.  Glen Pass kicked my butt today and I've certainly read stories about people struggling on Forester and it's 1000' higher than anything else I've done on this trip.  I'm camped at around 10,000' so I have 3200' of climb over about 5 miles but, of course, it's all at a high altitude.  I should be able to do it just fine, but there's still always that nagging doubt.</p>

<p>I've talked to Steph about the finish date and I've decided that my plan will be to go up Whitney and all the way down in the same day so I'd reach Whitney Portal Tuesday evening rather than Wednesday morning.  I'll make the final call when I get down to Trail Camp on the descent from Whitney and let her know then, but if I have the energy I'd love to do that last 6 miles down from Trail Camp that evening and get down sooner.  I love being out here, but these last few days have been quite the grind and I'd really just like to be done now.  I've told Steph that I won't be down before 5pm so she can plan her day around that.  I've done my own calculations and figure that if I leave Guitar Lake at 6am to head up to Whitney and spend 40 minutes on the top of Whitney, I should be able to get down to Whitney Portal by 4pm (9+ hrs of hiking).  So, that gives me an hour to spare.  If I get there before she does, I'll just enjoy my veggie burger and fries and relax while I wait.
