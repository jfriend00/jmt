<p>We'd already chosen a southbound hike.  The other key tenets of the hike are planning the duration of your hike, where you are going to get resupplies from and how transportation is going to work.  For a group of people who have never hiked this many days in a row and have certainly not hiked even more than 3 days in a row in the last 30 years, it's not particularly obvious how long this hike will take for us.  How many miles a day can we hike?  Do we need days off (called zero days)?  In the end, we find on the web an itinerary from someone else's trip that seems doable to us and it does the whole trail in 20 days.   Here’s what the initial daily plan looks like where each day’s camp is shown with the vertical dotted red line.</p>

<p>This plan has daily mileage numbers from 6-16 miles, but generally in the 12-13 miles/day and that seems doable to us.  From our practice hikes, we seem like we can do 2mph OK when hiking without really killing ourselves so we should be able to hike for 6 hours a day and make 12 miles, even throwing in the complications of altitude and climbs (well actually it's a wild guess, but it seems feasible).  So we set out to plan for 20 days.</p>

<p>Now, with a 20 day duration, we need to figure out how we get new supplies (mostly food) along the trail.  There are two immediate, no-brainer resupply stops at Tuolumne Meadows and Red's Meadow.  Tuolumne Meadows would be our 2nd or 3rd day (depending upon how the logistics work for our departure) and Red's Meadow is about 3 days more from Tuolumne Meadows.  Some people wonder why resupply in only your 2nd or 3rd day, but when your first introduction to altitude has you climbing more than 5000' in the first few days up over Cathedral pass, it starts to sound really smart to be carrying as little food/weight as possible over that first section.</p>

<p>To resupply at Tuolumne Meadows, you mail yourself a general delivery package to the Tuolumne Meadows Post Office.  They will hold it for up to 30 days and you can then pick it up any time that the post office is open.  Sounds simple enough.   Ahhh, but there's a catch.  The post office is a post office and it has post office hours.  Not open on Sunday - closes early on Saturday, doesn't open until 9am.  Hmmm, our first plan was to leave Glacier Point very early Saturday morning and arrive at Tuolumne Meadows Sunday afternoon.  Can't pick up our resupply package on Sunday.  Didn't think about this detail when getting our permit to start on a Saturday.  OK, we can work around this.  Rather than get to Yosemite on Friday, camp Fri night in the valley and then leave from Glacier Point early Saturday morning, we'll just drive up to Yosemite on Saturday and start our hike Saturday afternoon and our first night of camping will be on the trail rather than before starting the official hike.  This will put our arrival into Tuolumne on Monday where we can pick up our resupply package any time between 9-5.</p>

<p>35 miles from Tuolumne Meadows is a place right on the JMT called Red's Meadow.  It has a store, a restaurant, showers and laundry and a campground and they cater to thru hikers like us.  For a fee of $35, you can mail them a package and they will hold onto it until you get there to pick it up.  That will be our second resupply point.  So, for the first part of the hike, we're carrying 2 days of food, then 3 days of food.  Perfect.</p>

<p>The next two resupply options are Vermillion Valley Resort (33 miles, 3 days from Red's Meadow) or Muir Trail Ranch (55 miles, 5 days from Red's meadow).  Vermillion Valley Resort (VVR) is not exactly on the JMT.  It's about 5 miles off the JMT.  You can hike about 1.5 miles and then take a ferry across Lake Thomas Edison to VVR (if the ferry is running).  They very much cater to and encourage hikers, but it's a bit of a diversion and costs you at least a half a day of progress, perhaps even a whole day.  Muir Trail Ranch (MTR) supports hiker resupply (for $55/package, you can mail them a resupply package and they will hold it for you) and MTR is only a short distance off the JMT.  We decide to plan for the 5 days from Red's Meadow to MTR and skip VVR.  It's a longer stretch from Red's Meadow, but MTR lines you up better for what comes next.</p>

<p>MTR is about the half way point of the JMT and it's really the last commercial/road access to anywhere near the JMT so resupply in the southern half of the trail gets much more complicated.  You have these options:
<ol>
    <li>Just carry all your food for the 2nd half.  In our case that would be 10 days of food.
</li>
    <li>Hike out off the trail to a local town/road or somewhere that you can get new supplies.</li>
    <li>Have someone bring you supplies over a pass (usually from the east) to the JMT so they are brought to you.
</li>
</ol></p>

<p>The “hiking out” option 2 doesn't really appeal to us.  At best it costs you a day but, depending upon where you choose to hike out, it can cost 2-3 days.  Having someone bring supplies to the JMT is the nicest way to get new supplies, but it is logistically complicated.  You can either have a supportive friend hike in with your supplies or you can hire someone to bring in your supplies (often on a pack mule).   We didn't have any particular supportive friends in mind to do this (you have to come in from the east which is a long ways from the Bay Area) so we didn't pursue that option.  We investigated the pack mule option and it is certainly available.  It requires scheduling very long in advance exactly what day and location you will be to receive your supplies.  The packers are not allowed to leave your food anywhere - they must deliver it directly to you.  They will then take your trash as you repack with the supplies they brought.  It's also expensive, though if you can coordinate/share with other hikers, the cost per hiker can be reduced.  In the end, we decided that we didn't want to be forced to a specific resupply schedule 3/4 of the way through our hike because that would wreck our freedom to go faster or slower if we do decided.  So, we elected the first option - to carry 10 days of food out of MTR.</p>

<p>To summarize, we will have three resupply points (Tuolumne Meadows, Red's meadow and Muir Trail Ranch).  This would give us food segments of 2 days, 3 days, 5 days and 10 days.  Like we were working up the altitude with the southbound hike, we're also working up the segment distance.  The big challenge with the 10 days of food is we now have to have a bear container that can hold that much food as all your food has to be in a bear container.  10 days of food is not small so this required us to have a pretty sizable bear container and it put a lot of pressure on that last segment of food planning to make sure it would all fit in the bear container.   OK, now we have a rough outline of the segments of the hike.</p>
