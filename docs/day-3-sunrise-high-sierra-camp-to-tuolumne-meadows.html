<h2>Sunrise High Sierra Camp to Tuolumne Meadows</h2>
<img class="photo" src="images/day-3-map.png">
<p>9.5mi, 380' up, 800' down, camp at 8630'</p>

<p>The morning is gorgeous and we're up early enough to see the sunrise over the eastern peaks.  My sleeping pad is still leaking so it was a bit of a restless night as I'd have to find comfortable positions without much air in the pad and then eventually wake up enough to blow it up again.  I need to find a river with enough water in it to submerge parts of the pad so I can find where the leak is (probably in the Tuolumne River this afternoon).  It got quite cold last night (perhaps high 30s), but my sleeping bag was more than warm enough.</p>

<p>Today's hiking should be a lot easier than yesterday.  Though we have almost 10 miles to go to Tuolumne, we don't have very much up and down.  It should only be about a 400' climb up to Cathedral Pass and then a descent into Tuolumne.  Of course, the real trail is always more up/down than just that, but overall it should be an easy day which I think we are all glad for as yesterday was a hard initiation day into the rigors of altitude and longer mileage days.</p>

<p>We're close enough to the high sierra camp at Sunrise that we can actually hear the horn they blow when meals are ready.  We can't see it, but it must not be too far away.  On to Tuolumne Meadows. It takes only minutes until we arrive at the Sunrise High Sierra Camp and we stop briefly there to look around.   There's a water faucet, a small store, a mess hall that looks like it could hold 30-40 people and tent cabins.  It's a beautiful location next to a big meadow with nice cathedral spires around.  In talking to one of the guests staying there, it's a lottery system.  There are zillions of people applying for only a few spots and it's pretty lucky if you actually get in.  The general idea is that you hike in to the camp and then use it as a home base for day trips.  They feed you and provide shelter.  I think you can either carry your own gear in or have your gear brought in on mules.</p>

<p>As we leave Sunrise, there's a walk through an appropriately named "Long Meadow" and I'm busy capturing photos of various views of the meadow with Cathedral Peaks in the background.  Then we start climbing up to Cathedral Pass which turns out to be a fairly short climb.  Once up at the pass, we get even nicer views of the high country and we head on towards Cathedral Lakes.  Once on the other side of Cathedral Pass nearer to Cathedral Lakes, we start to run into a lot more hikers, all coming from Tuolumne.  Some are overnight hikers based out of Tuolumne and some are day hikers.  Though I'd be hard pressed to say it was now crowded, I have come to appreciate it when there are fewer people.  We stop near one of the lakes for an extended break and a snack (though it's still relatively early in the day).</p>

<p>On the descent into Tuolumne, we come upon this spring that is literally bubbling out of the ground right next to the trail and then flowing downhill.  It seems like a perfect place for a break and to grab some water as it's hard to imagine the water can get any more pure than this.  It's literally bubbling out of the side of a hill.  There must be some sort of aquifer from above that meets the surface here on the side of this hill.  Many are drinking directly from the spring, but we're still using our Steripens with their UV purifier to purify the water before drinking.</p>

<p>We head down the remaining portion of the descent towards Tuolumne Meadows and when it seems like we should be really close to our destination, it turns out Tuolumne Meadows is pretty long and we actually have another two miles to go to get to the Post Office and Tuolumne Grill which is our first destination (I've heard some people hop a shuttle bus for this two miles, but we walk).</p>

<p>We take some pictures in Tuolumne Meadows and then arrive at the Post Office and grill.  The Post Office has a sign in the window that they are "Closed for Sorting".  Presumably that means that the day's packages arrived and they are organizing them.  We have no idea when they'll actually open up so we can pick up our resupply package.  Anyway, the first order of business is a visit to the bathrooms and wash basins to clean up a bit and then we're into the Tuolumne Grill to order some lunch.  The Grill is a busy place and it takes a little while to get our food, but eventually I'm able to settle down with a veggie burger, some fruit and a soda which tastes quite good.</p>

<p>We're sitting with other backpackers on some picnic tables and it soon becomes apparent that there are a bunch of folks doing the Pacific Crest Trail (PCTers they are called going from Mexico to Canada) also waiting for the Post Office to open.  Eventually the Post Office does open and we're able to retrieve our package (to my delight there were no snafus in the package delivery).  We sort through our stuff, reload our bear containers, get rid of some trash and we head over to the backpacker's campground to claim a spot to camp.  Since it's early in the day yet (I think it was just about 2pm), the backpacker's campground is still pretty empty (it's only for single night stays for backpackers) so there are lots of sites to choose from.</p>

<p>Once in camp, my first order of business is I'm taking my air mattress down to the river and going to see if I can find and fix that leak.  Fortunately, it's pretty easy to find the leak, but keeping track of where the leak is while you get the air out of the pad and get it dry enough to put a patch on proves to be an interesting problem because I don't have anything with me to mark on the pad where the leak is when I find it (a pen or piece of tape would have been useful).  The first time I go through the process I end up putting a nice perfect patch in the wrong place.  So, start over.  This time I get the patch in the right place and it seems to be all fixed and there are no other leaks.</p>

<p>Now that the air mattress is fixed, I go fetch my clothes and it's time for laundry.  Time to wash basically everything I have (including myself) in the river.  I'm going to wash all three pairs of hiking socks and hope that one of them gets dry enough for hiking in the morning.  The Tuolumne river is not exactly warm, but it's a warm afternoon so it's quite pleasant.  The other guys have found a section of river where you can slide/float a little ways and are doing that a few times.  I'm content to hang in my little swimming hole, clean up and soak up some sun.  We end up talking to an older gentleman who, after finding out we're doing the JMT, shares his experiences doing it 40 years ago with very primitive equipment.</p>

<p>As dinner time rolls around, though we have dinners in our packs, we decide to go back to the Tuolumne store and buy some things for dinner.  I buy a couple dinners you can microwave right there in the store and I eat both of the dinners (one is spiced potatoes and the other is curry) spooned into tortillas.  It's a ton of food and I'm stuffed when we're done, but it tastes delicious.  When you've been exercising so much that you're running a calorie deficit, it's amazing how good food tastes!</p>

<p>The weather looks clear so I decide to sleep out under the stars tonight.
