Issues:

Expando for video to go full width, but not full screen

Decide whether expando for images should be full-size images or full-width screen or auto-detect if images are already full width?

Decide if I want a help icon?

Decide if I want expando image height to be known so it will layout the right height immediately?

Should we animate the expando height change?

How to indicate that panos are zoomable?
