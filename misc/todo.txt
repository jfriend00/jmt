Issues:

Expando for video to go full width, but not full screen

Decide whether expando for images should be full-size images or full-width screen or auto-detect if images are already full width?

Decide if I want a help icon?

Decide if I want expando image height to be known so it will layout the right height immediately?

Should we animate the expando height change?  (actually don't know how because height is "auto" and you can't use CSS transition with auto height)

How to indicate that panos are zoomable?
