<text>Fortunately, the high Sierras in the summer are not generally that cold.  While it can get down below freezing at night at high altitude, it doesn't usually get that cold.  The key is layers and not too many of them.  While it certainly can rain in the Sierras (afternoon thunderstorms are relatively common), this is not the Pacific Northwest where you can expect regular and long rain.   Here's the clothing I settled on:
<ul>
    <li>Convertible Pants for hiking and wearing when cool - REI Sahara</li>
    <li>Swim Trunks (backup hiking wear, something to wear if pants are being washed)</li>
    <li>Two pairs of non-cotton underwear (one to wear, one to wash/dry) - ExOfficio Boxer Briefs</li>
    <li>Hiking socks (I decided to take 3 pairs and I used silk sock liners in addition to my hiking socks)</li>
    <li>Long sleeve shirt (ExOfficio)</li>
    <li>Short sleeve shirt (non-cotton)</li>
    <li>Insulated Jacket (REI Revelcloud - PrimaLoft fill - stays warm even if wet)</li>
    <li>Silk long underwear - as much for sleeping wear as for emergency warmth</li>
    <li>Wind/Rain Jacket</li>
    <li>Buff (multipurpose head warmer - much more useful than a beanie)</li>
    <li>Vented wide brim sun hat</li>
    <li>Mosquito netting for head</li>
    <li>Lightweight Gloves</li>
    <li>Rain Mitts (you slide these over the lightweight gloves if it's a cold, sustained rain - this is the only clothing item I didn't use)</li>
</ul>
I generally hiked in my long sleeve shirt to keep the sun off my arms.  I used the zip-off legs on my convertible pants more than ever before on any other trip.  I put the legs on anytime there were lots of mosquitoes or in the evening/morning when it was cool.  I took them off for hiking (except on a few occasions when it was cold during the day)
I could have done without my swim trunks because we always went swimming in our underwear as it was a convenient way to wash them off at the same time (and they dry really quickly).

The mosquito head netting is very small and light and it got used a few times.  We never needed it while hiking, but did need it a couple times in camp.

The silk long underwear was not ever needed for warmth, but I used it for sleepwear to both separate my skin from the sleeping bag and to keep the sleeping bag clean from my body.  This worked out really well and it would have offered some additional warmth if needed.  I read about this idea late in the preparation and decided to get these at the last minute instead of taking my skiing long underwear which have just been for warmth.  I thought this was a great idea.

The buff is a really cool piece of headwear.  It can be used for warmth (I slept in it a few nights and used it in camp/mornings a few times and on Whitney which was very cold) and it can be fashioned in many different forms depending upon what you want.  It can also protect a fair amount of head/neck from bugs.

My gloves were only used once on the last day on Whitney, but certainly it can be cold enough for gloves.

I wore the same long sleeve shirt every day.  I could wash it, hang it out to dry and put it on the next day even if it wasn't quite yet dry and it would dry while wearing it within a short time.  While I've had the ExOfficio shirt for awhile, only on this trip did I actually use it the way it's really intended.

I used both of the velco pockets all the time (eye glasses in one and sun glass cloth in the other or actually store the sunglasses there if not wearing them).  While my shirt never once looked clean on the trip, a quick rinse in a river always seemed to get rid any body odor fairly easily (non-cotton is essential) and it dried really quickly.  It did get clean again after the trip with Clorox.  I used the velcro pockets in the hiking pants too.  Maps in a ziplock with compass went in one pocket and my wilderness permit, money and id went in the other (also in a ziplock).

I would suggest a new pair of hiking socks in at least one resupply as it was not uncommon for socks to develop a hole or one of my pairs kind of stretched out so that the heel wasn't in the right place any more.  I also saw several pairs of hiking socks left on a rock to dry so it's possible to lose some too.
