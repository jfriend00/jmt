<h2>Day 7 - Red's Meadow to Purple Lake</h2>

<text>In the morning, Pete gives me the thumb's up which means that he and Corey will continue on.  Cool.  We grab a breakfast at the Red's restaurant (pancakes and potatoes) which is again delightful and then we're off on our next major segment.

It's a long, hot climb out of Red's with several dry stretches (no water).  It goes first through a very large 1997 forest fire burn area that burned pretty much everything and was apparently stopped just short of the Red's Meadow resort.  We see lots of deer in this burn area which is now the home to lots of shrubs and many young trees.   Then it switchbacks up a steep slope and crosses a creek that's covered in beautiful flowers.  We stop briefly at the creek to fill up on water, but the biting flies are thick and pesky - definitely not enjoyable.  I have to pull out my insect repellent just to try to keep the flies from biting the backs of my hands and legs.</text>

<text>As we get up the switchbacks and out of the valley that Red's Meadow is in, we start getting pretty amazing views.  We can see back to the north to the Ritter range and Donahue Pass where we came from the previous days and as we make a little more progress, we can see west across the San Joaquin River and then Fish Valley to some big peaks and then later in the day, we can see south to even bigger peaks that we're headed to.  I particularly enjoy the days when we can see a lot and this day is one of those (also lots of opportunities to take pictures too).  There are often new views around every corner.  Though it's hot and dry and we have more than 2500' to climb, it's probably the most scenic day so far (widest variety of scenery all day long).</text>

<text>After a particularly long, dry spell (almost 5 miles) and pretty much right about when we run out of water, we finally arrive at Duck Creek.  Boots come off, feet go in the water.  I drink nearly two liters of water.  It's mid afternoon and we all sit down and eat.</text>

<text>We could hike uphill to Duck Lake and camp there or we could continue on to Purple Lake which involves a bit of up and down, about a 500' climb and then 700' descent.  After some debate, we decide to head for Purple Lake 2.5 miles away.</text>

<text>When we arrive at Purple Lake and it's already getting a bit crowded there (5 or 6 groups of people) so it takes a little while to settle on a campsite.  The father/son from Indiana are there again as are a number of other southbound through hikers.

Like at Lyell, the first order of business is to get ourselves and our clothes clean.  As always, Corey is the first one in the lake.  I wash my clothes and lay them out on sunny rocks to dry and then manage to get myself into the cold water.  Once you're out and clean, it feels great, but I'm not a fan of the actual act of dunking yourself in the cold water.
While we're bathing, there's a helicopter going back and forth along the cliffs a couple miles behind Purple Lake.  Then, at one point we hear (on a what must have been a very, very powerful loudspeaker) "Stay where you are, we will be back".  The helicopter flies off and about 20-30 minutes later comes back again.  This time he appears to land and presumably picks up someone that he was rescuing and then flies away.  We never did figure out exactly what happened.  The guess was rock climbers that needed help.

We've seen very few northbound folks.  There was one family with a teenage daughter that looked to be struggling a bit and not at all happy.  Most of the PCTers have apparently already gone through earlier.  We do see one JMTer who turned around because of health issues (dehydration he thinks) and is headed back to Mammoth to get some medical attention.

At Purple Lake, as the sun is going down, we see a group of four hikers coming up a side trail from down by Fish Creek.  As it turns out, they are trail workers that were working on the trail down by Fish Creek and they're coming up here (headed to Virginia Lake) on their days off.  They all look like college age kids doing some hard work for the summer.

The hiking traffic on this side of Red's is a fraction of the other side.  I guess there are many better destinations much closer to Red's in the other direction.  While Purple Lake is a nice place, it's a long ways from Red's and there wasn't much in between so it's really only JMT traffic here.

My feet and legs are doing very well.  My back and core are pretty wiped by the end of the day and in need of rest and Advil.  I'm staying under my daily allotment of Advil so far (which is a good sign), but I definitely need the Advil regularly. I guess my preparation did a good job with the cardio and leg strength, but maybe not as good a job with core strength.

Pete doesn't think he and Corey will go past MTR.  I ask him if maybe Corey could go back with Richard and then Pete and I could continue on, but Pete's not interested in that so I start thinking about whether I would do the second half solo or not - several more days before any decision has to be made.

There's a very nice sunset (lots of color in the clouds and canyon walls) and I think we can now see why it's called Purple Lake.
