<text>Corey is still struggling with his bloody nose, but seems to have it stopped by stuffing gauze into his nose.   He doesn't look very comfortable or happy today.  In general the miles went quickly today.  We had a few modest climbs out of lakes, but generally it's gently sloped downhill all the way to Red's Meadow and we all kind of seemed like a "horse drawn to water" - ready to get to Red's.   After three hours on the trail, we'd done 8 miles which is pretty good for us (we would usually average 2mph or even a little less than that).

We come down a long, very dry slope and take a good break at a river crossing.  I'm discovering that I have my first blisters on the back of the heels of both feet.  After tending to my feet with blister band-aids and baby powder and fresh socks, I come to the conclusion that maybe I had my boots too tight.  In an effort to protect my little toe on the downhill, I think I over cranked my boots and that forced enough pressure onto my heels to cause them to blister.  I go with a lighter touch on the laces for the rest of the day to Red's and my heels do much better.

For several hours of the hike this day, we are astounded by all the downed trees.  There are places where it looks like maybe 75% of the trees have been blown down and all facing the same direction.  Many are knocked over with rootballs exposed.  Many others are just snapped off 20-30' up.  We have a faint recollection of a giant Sierra wind storm in 2011 that did all this damage and when we get back we look it up and confirm that is indeed what happened.  Very strong winds came from an unusual direction and created severe downslope winds.  The unusual direction of the wind (which the trees are not as prepared for as the normal westerly storm winds) combined with the high velocity downslope winds (150-200mph) knocked hundreds of thousands of trees down in one storm in 2011.</text>

<text>As we approach Red's, we can see Devil's Post Pile across on the other side of the river valley and we decide to go a little out of our way to see it up close.  After that detour (which is pretty cool), we head toward's Red's Meadow Resort.<text>

<text>A trail is closed for forest maintenance (we can see them clearing underbrush) so we have to walk a bit on the road to get to the resort and finally we see the main sign and arrive at around 1:30.  We pop into the restaurant and order lunch where another veggie burger tastes simply delightful.  After eating, we head over to the showers and wow - how nice does a hot shower feel (the first one in 6 days)!  For $10, you get a towel, shampoo, soap and a key to the shower.  I honestly don't know how long I stood in that shower, but it was awhile.

After getting ourselves cleaned up, we start some laundry in their washing machines, pick up our resupply package and start sorting through our food for the next segment.</text>

<text>Pete tells me that Corey isn't particularly enjoying the trip.  He isn't sleeping very well, he's got these bloody noses and maybe is missing some peer company (how can three 50+ year old men not be great company?).  They aren't quite sure if they're going to keep going or not.  Pete says they'll decide in the morning and even if they do continue, Pete has trail exits figured out for the next few days if they decide they want to stop then.

Meanwhile, Richard is kind of the opposite.  He was scheduled to leave the trail here at Red's and catch public transportation back to his car in Yosemite, but he decides that he wants to extend his trip to Muir Trail Ranch (4-5 more days).  He scrambles to get some more food for the next segment, pulling things from the resupply extras bin and buying some things in the store.

I called Steph collect from a pay phone and we had a long conversation.  It sounds like things are going well at home (they are back from Virginia now) and Steph is glad things are going well for me on the trip.  Nice to hear about the family.

We share a campsite in the local campground with a number of other southbound JMT hikers and chat up our plans for the next few days.</text>

<text> After being out in the wilderness by ourselves, it's a bit of a rude awakening to be in a "car camp" campground with RVs, trailers, cars driving by, large bonfires, bright Coleman lanterns, large groups of people, etc...  Oh well.  Eventually I get to sleep.</text>
