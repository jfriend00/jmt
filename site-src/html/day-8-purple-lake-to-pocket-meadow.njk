<h2>Day 8 - Purple Lake Over Silver Pass to Pocket Meadow</h2>
{{macros.image("day-8-map.png", "13mi, 1300' down, 1800' up, 2400' down, camp at 8400'")}}
<text>The day starts by hiking to Lake Virginia which is a beautiful lake and we see the trail workers from the night before camped there.  I've never seen a lake quite as blue as this one is the way the light hits it.</text>

<text>Now we start a descent down to Fish Creek about 1300' feet below.  As we're headed up the trail, we can see where we're headed for the rest of the day as we have to go essentially across the canyon we're been hiking parallel to.  We descend down to Fish Creek, then up the other side of the canyon, then up and over Silver Pass.  When you can see it all laid out in front of you like this, it seems a bit daunting sometimes.  Perhaps it's better to not really be able to see it all this way.</text>

<text>It's a pretty steep, switch-backed descent down to Fish Creek through an area of heavy rock slide and not much vegetation where we re-enter the forest.  We follow Fish Creek downstream for a little while until we get to a sizable bridge that crosses it.  This is one of several bridges that have been constructed in the last 20 years.  Without these bridges, some of these rivers are very dangerous to cross in high water years or after rain storms.  No such issues here as we just walk across the bridge.</text>

{{macros.photo("/i-G35KVnT/0/edc1ab09/L/i-G35KVnT-L.jpg", "Fish Valley")}}

<text>The trail immediately starts climbing up the other side as we head up towards Silver Pass.  After a mile or so, we stop at a creek and fill up with water as we're not sure how much more water there will be until we get near the pass.  The whole area is covered in flowers.  A solo coed PCTer goes by looking like she'd only been on the trail for a few hours (we probably look like we've been on the trail for months) and she explains that she's got to get all the way to Red's Meadow today because she's just about out of food.  We do the math and realize she's doing twice as much mileage as us and then we realize how much less food one has to carry if you do that many miles a day (25 miles/day).  At that point, it's a whole different hike.

Anyway, we finish our break and start climbing again towards Silver Pass.  This is another one of those passes where you look up in the general direction you're heading and you wonder where in the heck are you actually going to cross.  Just when you think you might have an idea, more of the high country comes into view and you realize that you really have no idea where the trail goes exactly and the pass isn't close.  As we start to get up higher, we get some interesting views back behind us as one can see the Ritter Range in the far distance (where we were 3 days ago) and you start to get a sense of how far we go when you add up all the days.</text>

<text>As Richard and I regularly stop to take photos of something, we all get kind of spread out on this climb and, for awhile, it almost feels like I'm hiking by myself.  This is a pretty steep climb that's been going for awhile and I'm imagining what it will be like to do this every day for the next 10 days.  At times it feels like "yeah, I can do this!" and at other times it feels like "can I really do this day after day?".

We're headed up above the treeline again and come upon Squaw Lake (a glacial lake) before Silver Pass.  We can now see more clearly where we're headed (about 500' more of climbing), but we can also see some menacing clouds to the west of the pass.</text>

{{macros.photo("/i-2s5dqwT/0/d03ae8eb/L/i-2s5dqwT-L.jpg", "We can hear occasional thunder claps from the rain clouds")}}


<text>About half way up this last bit, we hear a big thunder clap in the direction of those menacing clouds.  It's not above us yet, but it sure looks like it could be coming this way.  We're feeling the effects of being over 10,000', but after that crack of thunder, we all decide that we better get over the pass and down the other side as soon as possible.  This group cranked up that last bit to the top and down the other side faster than I would have thought we could all move.  We didn't want to get caught on top in a thunderstorm and certainly didn't want to delay before getting over the pass.  We had planned a swim and long rest in Silver Lake on the other side of the pass, but with the threatening weather, we just wanted to keep going lower.  I found myself low on energy, my core hurting and my left leg really bothering me.  I had to take a short break even though the weather was threatening.  I rolled out my lower leg with the racquetball and it really helped my knee.  I could bend it again without pain or stiffness (kind of important on the descent) and a little food helped too. As the thunder booms from not too far away, we resume our descent as fast as possible.</text>

<text>As we started to get to a forested area and the threat of lightning right near us seemed not quite so great, we came upon a small creek and Pete took the opportunity to try to find the leak in his air mattress which had started to leak the night before.  It wasn't much of a creek, but he was able to eventually find his leak and mark it to be fixed later.  </text>

{{macros.photo("/i-TWv6DWZ/0/d76dd7f4/L/i-TWv6DWZ-L.jpg", "Pete trying to find his air mattress leak in a small creek")}}

<text>While at this creek, it starts to rain and now looks more threatening than just a few minutes ago (that's kind of how it goes with these clouds).  The building clouds certainly look like your typical afternoon thunderstorm so we're anxious to continue getting lower and as far away from lightning as possible.  The rain turns into hail and for a short while, we're getting BB sized hail.  We play the storm game a couple times, stopping to put our rain jackets on, then it stops raining and we get hot so we stop to take them off, etc...   We see some other JMTers that decide to just set up camp before it really starts raining (sometimes a good idea) even though it's still early in the day.  We really want to make more progress because there's a big climb tomorrow past the VVR junction and we'd like to get closer to the start of that climb.  As we reach a particularly steep part of the descent, we get some pretty hard rain and parts of the trail get a little dicey too as the rocks get wet.</text>

{{macros.photo("/i-5xHTpbC/0/48012d36/L/i-5xHTpbC-L.jpg", "Hiking in hail and slippery rocks")}}

<text>Pete takes a spill, but catches himself just enough to avoid serious impact.  I slip, but don't fall.  It's raining hard and now we'd really just like to find a place to camp, but we're in the middle of a switchback descent covered in steep rock so there's nothing here.  We need to get down to at least Pocket Meadow before we can find a camp site.  When we get there, the valley is pretty narrow and there isn't much room between river, trail and cliffs.  We see some people camped and a guy we've seen several other times named Kai is also camped there.  There isn't much room so we continue on a little further and finally find a spot just past the Mono Creek Trail junction that we can just barely fit four tents into.  It's got nice access to the creek, but the meadow seems to have attracted a lot of mosquitoes.</text>

{{macros.photo("/i-667gp6H/0/32612d5b/O/i-667gp6H.jpg", "Dinner time")}}

<text>There's quite a bit of thunder and based on counting seconds between lightning and thunder, it seems like it's about two miles away.  As it starts to get dark, the rain and thunder lets up and the sky starts to clear.  Pete has now told everyone that he and Corey (along with Richard) are leaving at MTR.  Time for me to discuss continuing on solo with Steph on the satellite phone the next day.
